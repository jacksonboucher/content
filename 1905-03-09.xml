                        We should like to call the attention both of our regular readers and of the visitors staying in Egypt, whose numbers are greater now than they have ever been, to the tenth annual report of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Mr. Horaoe Rumbold, the honorary secretary and treasurer of the society, in his most interesting report, which is accompanied by very full statements of aooounts and of the financial position of the branches established at Zagazig, Mansourah, Tantah, Assiout, Luxor, and Assouan, notes that both the balance and the receipts from subscriptions and donations have diminished during the past year. The falling off in subscriptions he ascribes to the foot that many former subscribers have left Egypt, while their places have remained unfilled. The decrease in the donations indicates either indifference to the aims of the society, or a oomplete misunderstanding of its financial position. Ignorance cannot well be pleaded : there is not a single large hotel at Cairo, or Helouan where the notices of the 8-P.C.A. do not occupy prominent positions, and it is impossible to imagine for a moment that the average tourist has suddenly become hardened to the possibility of animal suffering. There remains the other alternative: that one visitors mis understand the financial situation of the society, and this we believe to be the cause of the decreased support which Mr. { Rumbled notes. In this the last paragraph of the report deserves quotation in ; fulfill “The society has now completed 10 years’ work, during which it may fairly claim to have |
                        brought about a complete change in the Condition of animals in and around Cairo. Visitors and residents, who have known Cairo before S.P.C.A. existed, are unanimous in bearing wi ness to the revolution brought about through the agency. The sum recovered in the course  the year from owners of animals treats in the infirmary must inevitably constitute the largest proportion of the income of the society. Experience has shown, however, this the receipts under this head can never equate the expenditure, and that the society will • ways be dependent, to &amp; certain extent, c outside contributions. Residents in Egypt fully do their duty in supporting the society The same cannot be said of the thousands will visit Egypt every winter. The contribution of visitors during 1904 scarcely reached L.E.2 out of a total income of over L.K.3,500. J no year have they exceed L.K.100. £ platonic sympathy with the  and objects of the society are readily forth coming, but do not assume a concrete or practical shape” The italics are ours, for to passage deserves to be emphasised : it is eat to assume an interested sympathetic air but unfortunately this simulated interest has a wi of departing with those who have aroused i Quite number of otherwise excellent people respond to an appeal to their sympathy adult generosity with the regularity of one of tho pleasing machines, once so popular in British seaside resorts, into while penny was insert! and a puppet willingly danced or played put the simulacrum of a musical instrument, ai with about the same practical result.
                        We confess to a fear that exhortations ai appeals will prove vain against such meter cal temperaments, but there must be urban of whiter visitors whose intellects are as precept cal as their instincts are generous, and who Da to support the S.P.C.A. as it( deserves owing! a misapprehension of its financial position. realise as well as they do that the society to deal with Cairo thoroughly and effectively, but they do not realise that, unless • the society to mark time, perhaps for years, then help needed to enable it to extend its operation in the provinces. A society that confirm its work for ever to the Capital you deserve to be compared to a police thi enforced peace and order in London, Brig ton, Birmingham, and Manchester and, oo tentedly supine, permitted outlaws to reassei bio in Sherwood Forest and highwayman to haunt the Portsmouth road. It is ti wish of the committee and members of to S.P.C.A. to give to their operations a wid scope, and sooner or later to establish enter at all the principal towns in Egypt, from who the treatment of animals, not only in the towns, but in the surrounding villages, can I watched, and infraction* of the laws relating cruelty to animals noted and brought before the responsible authorities. Anyone who 1 the fellaheen of Egypt understands that all their good points, they are curiously less of animal suffering, and indict a amount of unnecessary pain on the beasts of they possess and, at times, on the wild tares that Call into their hands. We do wish to give any colour to the that the Moslem is cruel to beasts hi Moslem, for the enlightened Mob holds strong views as to his duty town animals, and will bite passages from Koran in favor of humanity. But ran in Christian and in ^lost cities is usually accompanied by a cruelty towards animal suffering, the consequence of which differ in no way from those active cruelty, and the fellah is admitted ignorant and callous. We therefore vent to appeal to our visitors to remember the there are other places in Egypt besides Cair Luxor, and Assouan, and that while to S.P.C.A. has done great things in a limits area and with limited resources, it needs help to enable it to continue and to extend its work. No amount of good wishes balances a donation, however small.

                    <p>The expected movement in Egyptian miuing shares is at hand, or at any rate it
                        seems so. Norlh Niles will probably wait ontil Nile Valleys give a lead, but
                        those in tbe market who regard them with even greater favor than the shares
                        of the older company (from a purely market standpoint) are not entirely
                        without reasons. The issued capital is very small, only about £39,000, and
                        an appreciation in price would probably be more rapid in the case ot the
                        subsidiary than in that of the parent. By band crushing alone £3,000 worth
                        of gold bsB been recovered, and 5,000 feet of development work has been
                        done, Nubias are quiet, and so are the rest of the list, bnt there are
                        various considerations which point to an impending revival of interest in

                    <p>The report for 1904 states that the Urn Rus Gold Mines of Egypt (Limited)
                        with a capital of £150,000, of which £50,000 is working capital, was ’
                        issued to the public on the 6th of February last year, and the purchase
                        consideration of £5,000 cash aud 33,333 fully-paid shares has been paid over
                        to the company. It is expected that regular crush- ings on the Um Rus Mine
                        will commence in the course of a few weeks. Five thousand of the remaining
                        40,000 unisoued working capital shares were applied for and allotted at the
                        close of the financial year. The company has now ample funds in hand, as the
                        subsidiary companies in which they are largely interested are carrying on
                        the development work, and no expenditure on this account is being incurred
                        by the company. Just after the close of tbe year the Sudan Minos (Limited)

                    <p>A BRILLIANT SPECTACLE.</p>
                    <p>The fancy-drees ball at the Ghezireh Casino on Tuesday night was a remarkably
                        brilliant and successful entertainment. Residents and visitors came in
                        crowds, some powdered, many in fancy dress, and it was one of those nights
                        when the phrase “nearly everybody seems to be here” was true for once in a
                        way. A list of those who were present would be too long for our space—and
                        perhaps for our readers—besides being impossible to give, and we oonfine
                        ourselves to a description of the costumes that impressed us most, though we
                        cannot pretend to describe the dresses worn by so many fair members of tbe
                        more charming sex, and mtast apologise to all those whom we may leave
                        uomentioned for the lack of taste that drove us to neglect, or the
                        forgetfulness that prevent- ed us from noting, what they wore.</p>
                    <p>The ball room of the Ghezireh Palace Casino always looks well when lit up and
                        decorated, and never looked better than on Tuesday night, wheu the
                        costumesof the dancers,mostly in excellent taste, and worn with grace, made
                        a wonderful ‘V»up d'ceil.” It would be i possible to piok opt tbe
                        best—comparisons of costumes are the most odious of all,—but we may say that
                        Mr. Geoffrey Milward, in black and orange brown, was one of the finest
                        Morgans or Captains Kidds that we have ever seen. Mrs. Milward, powdered aud
                        in rich brocade, deserves special praise for not waving her hair; result—a
                        costume thoroughly in keeping with the XVillth century and historically
                        accurate. Many others wore their hair in the manner of the XXth century, and
                        the picture, charming in parts, just failed to oonvince as a whole.</p>
                    <p>Another pirate, and a gigantic and redoubtable figure in three-cornered hat
                        and waving plumes, was Bimbashi Kelly, E.A. Bimbasbi Cummins looked well as
                        a Rapin from Montmartre, and we must not forget Capt. Byrne as a
                        Mousquetaire of the Guard of the Bourbons, and Capt. Jeimings (R. I. Fus.),
                        who impersonated with singular accuracy an Egyptian warrior of the
                        monuments. Miss Rees looked charming as a paysanne. Miss Joseph and Miss
                        Walford were Veroniques : each had treated the part in a different spirit
                        and each succeeded iu giving a charming picture of Messager’s heroine. Miss
                        Pigeon as Queen Winter, adomed with holly and icicles, and Miss Gladys
                        Royle, as a white and stately Dresden shepherdess, were amazingly good., and
                        we must not forget Mr. Young, arrayed as a buck of George IV.’s days. There
                        were groups, too. and the best of these came from the officers of the 2ud

                        leading into the ball room all the heroes of the story, the Mad Hatter,
                        Tweedledum and Tweed led ee, the Red aud White Queens, the White Knight,
                        long spoon for the nasal of his helmet, course the Walrus and the Carpenter,
                        its and Pierrettes swarmed, as did tbe the suits, and Queens of Hearts and

                        the ball-room. Mr. Forestier- Walker had the happy idea of appearing as a
                        black “La Tosca.” Capt Whiffen was a very desperate-looking desperado, and
                        Capt Tncker a huge aud picturesque stock rider. Mr. Soott- Moncrieff was a
                        dark and diabolical Arab ; will be pardon ns for saying that he evoked
                        memories of coaling at Port Said ? Mr. Peyton aud Mr. Clogstouu were
                        sailor-boys, while Mr. Paxton and Mr. Tod appeared as costers in all the
                        glory of pearlies and wonderfully cat continuations. Dr. Phillips, as a
                        barrister, Mr. Welldon, as a convict, and Mr. Hankey, as a cavalier, all
                        deserve mention. There were Japanese of both sexes, among whom Mrs. Garrett,
                        Mrs. Drummond-Hay, and Miss Hume were charming Geishas. Mrs. Warnock as a
                        Marquise and Mrs. Elliot Smith as Evangeline looked extremely well, and Mrs.
                        Symmors was a most successful Portia. Many ladies bad merely powdered, and
                        powder suited them.- Mrs. Wild and Mrs. Donegan looked very well so, while
                        pictoies served as models to Miss Caution, who made a charming Romney, and
                        to Mrs. Ray, who in powder, ringlets, skirts and picture hat, followed
                        Gainsborough. Mr. Moroorn was an effective Sheikh. Messrs. Hicks and
                        ltobiuson were impressive students of A1 Azhar, while Maj. Donegan and Mr.
                        S. de Bilinaki appeared in hunting pink. There were some splendid Bedouins,
                        Mr. Niabet and Mr. Bennett perhaps most striking of them all, and Miss de
                        Codt was a picturesque aud accurate Dolly Varden. Mr. Blencowe came as a
                        Toreador, as did Capt Carey, who was aocompauied by Miss Carey, who was
                        remarkably good as Cannon, and we must not forget Mohamed Bey—we do not know
                        which of the many Mohamed Beys he is, but hear that he is Prince Halim’s
                        wakeel— who came arrayed as a Pathan notable.</p>
                    <p>The Hon. Arthur Davey looked extremely well as a Pierrot The Hon. Mrs. Davey
                        was very much admired as “Black and White.” Another very artistic costume
                        was that of Miss Leverich, in black and silver, as “Night” Then there was a
                        Sunflower Girl and many others, the vague memory of whom makes us curse our
                        forgetfulness of the details of their dress.</p>
                    <p>The dancing was animated. That goes without saying on such occasions. At 1
                        a.m. a great multitude swarmed to supper and overflowed to side rooms where
                        flash-light photos were taken. After supper came more dancing till 5.15
                        a.m., when the ball at last ended. The arrangements were as perfect as they
                        always are at Ghezireh. May the Savoy dance on the 14th rival this—it will
                        be very hard to surpass it.</p>

                    <p>London, March 3rd it may be safely stated that the source* of information at
                        the disposal of the magnate* of the London Stock Exchange are more far-rr
                        ch- ing and reliable than any other. Even the I eat opinion of the chances
                        of succees of the armies in the field, with all the gathered available news
                        from public and private sources, can be, and no doubt is, secured by those
                        to whom the upshot of events means loss or gain of many millions. When,
                        therefore, a movement of general confidence takes place, and Consols and
                        other securities (whioh,so to speak,“beattime”) and Japanese Stocks show
                        special strength, it is easy to gauge “the fact” that the best informed have
                        made up their minds as to the general course of events. The latest
                        information from Manchuria seems to have fully confirmed these views, and
                        amply justified the discounting of the future that has taken place. There is
                        ofily oue weak spot. Will the French* holders of Kmmi*n stock lose their
                        heads “en masse” in case ot the farther casualties impeding ? T‘ at the fall
                        of Port Arthur, the destructio t oi .he Russian fleet, and the state of
                        practical t t u tion into which Russia has been plunge a by the insensate
                        action oi the Tsar, have been borne by the French investor frith extraordi
                        nary ‘’sang froid,” so much so that the power of obtaining new loans in that
                        oountry seems still unexhausted,give reason to hope that they will bear
                        future troubles without panic. Certainly the conditions of sale, and the
                        advioe from head-centres, will act in that direction. The French are,
                        however, an impulsive people, aud liable to act foolishly when once “on the
                        run.” Should the scare take place, what would be the effect t This has been
                        well thought-out and discussed in high financial circles this week, with the
                        conclusion that, with prices of best securities at their present level,
                        there is not much to fear. The weight ot a heavy drop would fall on Paris,
                        and „at the moment, being in au exceptionally strong monetary position,
                        should be able to bear it. French holders of South African shares would, no
                        doubt, be obliged to realise to some extent, heuce the halting condition of
                        that market,but otherwise the effect on our Stock Exchange would' be mostly
                        sympathetic, and the result of near peace, coming as an offset to Russian
                        disasters, would have a strengthening tendency. The very lall in Russians,
                        if it take place, will make an unanswerable argument for peeoe, for, as
                        Napoleon said, to oommand success in war three things are essential1st,
                        money; 2nd, money; 3rd, money.</p>
                    <p>Gilt-edged securities still continue to be the leading feature of the
                        stock-markets, and at the time of writing they stand generally at the
                        highest .level touched lor a long time past Money is cheap, and, what is
                        more important, there is strong evidence that, in this section at any rate,
                        there is a revival of public confidence. Thure has been a steady demand for
                        better-class stocks, which has been well sustained dining the past lew
                        weeks. The supply of investment stocks is comparatively limited, and a
                        continuance of buying in this quarter, such as seems more than probable,
                        mast ultimately so raise prices that in a lew months’ time, perhaps
                        ieas,they will teach a level which will yield a very much smaller return,
                        and moreover, leave much less scope for speculation than is the case at
                        present. Then we shall see the further result, viz. the poblio will turn to
                        those markets which offer them most scope, and there will be a consequent
                        return ol activity in speculative stocks. Egyptian properties have
                        fluctuated- considerably this week. Natiou&amp;l Bauks are tbe most active
                        feature, having fallen beluw 26$ early in the week, but steadied again to 27
                        later. It is only to be expected that the rapid rise in prioe should produce
                        a fairly large amount of profit making, for, good-as this property
                        undoubtedly is, the upward movement has been very rapid, and the return at
                        pieseut is certainly not proportionate, still less high enough to tempt
                        holders to look them up at these prioes. Agricultural Banks are steady at
                        lli- Daira Sanieh shares keep their prioe well at 25}r and are talked
                        higher. Egyptiau Salt and Soda at 2| seem high, but the shares are well
                        held, and we should not recommend selling “on speo.” We believe the purchase
                        of the Huileries is practically settled. Amongst forthcoming issues is the
                        Egyptian Trust and Investment Co. with a capital ot £200,000. It is not yet
                        on the market, bat as the capital is not large, and some good financial
                        names are mentioned in connection with it, it might easily be made a success
                        in the present prosperous state of Egyptian finanoes. There is a rather
                        better U ne in the mining section generally at the moment Egyptian mining
                        oompanies already show a distinot advanoe on last week's prioes, though as
                        yet business is very limited in the mining market generally. Egypt and Sudan
                        stand at 2 which includes a dividend of 25 per cent and rights to the value
                        of another 75 % in shares of the Sudan Goldfield, Ltd., and the prioe seems
                        low.</p>

                        Alexandria, are by no means of rare oocurrenoe, and these are looked forward
                        to with pleasurable expectancy, by professors, pupils, parents, and friends
                        alike, for some weeks prior to the actual date of performance. We have been
                        privileged to witness many of these entertainments, and to receive,
                        frequently, the weff-known generous hospitality at the hands of the good
                        Brothers. Tuesday’s “slanos rtar&amp;tive et musicals,” which was under the
                        distinguished patronage and presence of M. Pierre Girard, Consul of France,
                        proved no exoeption to the role, and the attractive nature of the programme
                        brought a large crowd of patroffs long before the hour announced for the
                        opening of the doors. The first part of the programme consisted of a musical
                        extravaganza entitled The Happy Man, adapted by Mr. J. Pearoe-Hill, who also
                        introduced several original songs, painted the very effective settings of
                        scenery, and trained the little company of some fifteen youngsters who took
                        part in the prodoo- tion. The performance was, in every way, an unqualified
                        suooesa ; indeed, some ot the young artistes showed suoh histrionic ability
                        as might weU be envied by much older aspirants. As the Rajah, Mr. Nelson
                        Schranz was impressive and acted with ease and dignity. This remark also
                        applies to Mr. G. Garcia, who ably supported the rile of Prinoe Foxi, the
                        grand Vizier. Mr. H. Klat made a very pleasing Prinoe Koko, and in the hands
                        of Mr. P. Esposito, the Court Magioian and Astrologer Ski Hi was a great

                        forth rounds of applause. Tbe staging was admirable, and the costumes
                        gorgeous. Throughout the performance net a point was missed, whksb speaks
                        volumes for the excellence of the college method, seeing that not a single
                        English youth appeared in the piece. Tbe second portion of the programme was
                        devoted to a musical pieoe by Le Roy Villiers entitled Le Moulin du chat qui
