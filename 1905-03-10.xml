                    <head>The Battle of Mukden</head>
                    <p>The great fight that has now been raging for some days around Mukden will, to
                        all appearances, be hereafter considered one of the decisive battles of the
                        world’s history; and the great military catastrophe in Manchuria may well be
                        decisive not merely of the war but of the future of Russian autocracy. While
                        the Government is paralysed by the Terror at home the news from General
                        Kuropatkin’s army is ominous. There is no longer doubt that Oyama’s true
                        strategical objective has at last been attained, and that the Japanese are
                        in the rear of Kuropatkin and have out to the north the railway on which the
                        existence of the Russian armies depend. Now, unless the Japanese are driven
                        off, which is a most unlikely contingency, Russia will be brought face to
                        face with a tragedy, beside which all that Russia has as yet suffered of
                        disaster and humiliation would be as nothing.</p>
                    <p>It is worth while pausing to consider what the consequence must necessarily
                        be. it must be admitted that in the present case it will be staggering. Not
                        only will the present regime be thrown overboard, and, possibly, even a
                        wholly different form of government imposed. It is not only that the
                        traditional policy of Russia for many generations will, as a matter of
                        necessity, be abandoned, and a wholly different set of activities and
                        developments pursued in its place. Were these all, there might be found more
                        than one parallel for the situation, something to suggest the future of this
                        enormous people. But the real change lies deeper that (TOP the evolution of
                        9 new dynasty, or</p>

                        edition ol ibis very bandy little guide to Cairo and the Nile. The book,
                        while not of course enabling the tourist to dispense with bis Baedeker or
                        Murray, forms au excellent substitute for the more bulky guides while on
                        tour, being so woll-arranged that reference is easy in every way. We notice,
                        however, that the author, Mr. Keyuolds-Ball, B.A., has failed to mention, in
                        bis chapter on the regeneration of Egypt, the very important matter of the
                        Anglo French Agreement recently concluded. In oilier respects the book
                        appears to be well up to date, and it is published at tho moderate price of
                        half-a-crown.</p>

                        by all classes of the community, no less than by the English and American
                        visitors to this country. The last IKjrformauce of the Pirates of Penzance
                        was moreover, of such excellence as to render those who were prevented from
                        witnessing it very desirous of availing themselves of this second
                        opportunity. The caste is iden tical with that of the Royal performance, and
                        the representation will be exactly tin* >atne in every way. A full bouse is
                        therefore expected, and early application should be made for seats to

                        near Ras Garib. One of them came alongside tho steamer, and then followed at

                        responsible for the accident, and to ascertain especially whether the
                        alleged carelessness to the Ports and Lighthouses Administration contributed
                        materially to the damage done to the vessel.</p>

                    <p>At 10 o’clock last night, the beautiful garden behind Shcpheard’s Hotel was
                        filled with a large and animated crowd who had been attracted thither by the
                        promise of fireworks and of illuminations on a large scale. The whole of the
                        garden had been hung with multicoloured Chinese lauterus in tasteful design,
                        and there being no moon, the effect produced was extremely picturesque.
                        Electric lights had also been fixed in many of the trees, and the
                        rose-coloured lamps ou the tops ot the highest palms completed a very pretty
                        sight.</p>
                    <p>The fireworks were greatly appreciated and confetti were thrown with such
                        vigour, and in such quantity, that the paths were in places almost
                        ankle-deep. In spite of its being rather a cold night, the gardens were
                        thronged till a ate hour, while dancing went on in the Moorish central hall
                        till long after midnight A large number of well-known Cairo residents,
                        including many of the officers of the British and Egyptian forces, took part
                        in the festivities, and with them were a great number of tourists,
                        principally American, who all seemed to be enjoying themselves
                        immensely.</p>
                    <p>Among the diners in the restaurant, we noticed 11.1.H. Prince Adalbert of
                        Prussia, with a party of six, among whom was Dr. Rucker-Jenish, German
                        Consol General. Mrs. Carey also entertained a party of six, and other
                        parties were those of Mr. Rutherford, Mr. Devries, Mr. Hiller, Mr. Moroom,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>Others to be seen in tbe restaurant were the Rt. Hon. J. W. Mellor, Baron
                        Vogel von Falkenstein, Lady Bell, Countess Holnstein, and Vicomte de
                        Sapucahi.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian Infantry band discoursed a programme of music in one of the
                        comers of the garden, while the dance music was provided by the Tzigane
                        orchestra, whoso playing was much appreciated.</p>
                    <p>There were many supper parties in the grillroom and the gathering did not
                        disperse till nearly 2 o’clock this morning. Our thanks are due to Mr.
                        Baehler and his able staff for a very enjoyable evening.</p>

                            <p>A financial authority writes :—The promo tion of the Egyptian
                                Estates, Limited, is one of the fairest that 1 know oL The only
                                mistake in the prospectus, to my mind, is the omission to state two
                                points, which, instead of being against; are distinctly in favor of
                                the company. The first is that the directors have taken powers to
                                issue £1,000.000 of debentures. Presumably they would not pay more
                                than 4^ per cent for these and, taking for the sake of argument that
                                they could only make 6^ per cent, on their investments in this
                                country, this would give an extra profit of 4 per cent, on the
                                500,000 shares capital, quite apart from the profits derived from
                                the investment of the £500,000. The second point that does not
                                appear to be clearly stated in the prospectus is that the ordinary
                                shares not only receive a preferential dividend at 5 per cent but
                                accumulative preferential dividend. They then receive 65 per cent,
                                or two- thirds of the balance, and the directors have full powers to
                                create a general reserve fund before anything can be pai l to tbe
                                deferred shareholders. It /is obvious that the people connected with
                                the company are men of the highest integrity, and that a man, such
                                as Mr. Greville Palmer, who has been director of the Bank of Egypt
                                for 28 years, would not lend his name to any shady adventure.</p>

                                beer poisoned by strychnine at Honolulu. It il stated that the
                                poison was contained in « bottle of bicarbonate of soda, which she
                                bought originally at Adelaide, in Australia, and got refilled at San
                                Francisco. The deceased lady, who was eighty years of age, was
                                extremely wealthy, and professed to be infeai of a plot against her
                                life. She fied to Honolqlaq to secure, as she said, greater safety.
                                Her Am* rican relatives authorised a statement, completely rejecting
                                the poison theory, exphnning that Mrs. Stanford had been very ill
                                physic&amp;Uj and mentally, and was a victim to hallucina tions, the
                                strongest being that her life was in danger. She died at her hotel,
                                after returning from a picnic with her attendants.</p></note>
