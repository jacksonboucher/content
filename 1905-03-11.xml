                    <head>The Railway Report</head>
                    <p>e are pleased to learn that the recommendations of the Railway Commission are
                        beginning to take effect. We were able recently to announce that Major
                        Johnstone, the present chairman of the administration, is to be the first
                        general manager. He has oar good wishes in the task before him, and ’in its
                        performance his high qualifications and past experience should stand him in
                        good stead. We have, from the first, recognised the risks surrounding this
                        appointment, and we are glad the Government has decided to accept the least
                        of these. Major Johnstone’s appointment must be accepted as emphasising the
                        conclusion that the past defects in management were due to the system and
                        not to the individual. We do not know what further proofs of the same may'
                        be given, but it naturally occurs to ns that there will be vacancies
                        upstairs for either or both of the other members of the present board of
                        administration. Their great abilities and gear&amp;l qualifications
                        eminently fit them for such posts, but in ordinary business and on railways,
                        we have seen a manager practically deprived of his proper position by
                        predecessors in his office being similarly promoted. It must be clearly
                        recognized that the work to be done is that of the general manager—he must
                        not hark it if he will,— others must not do it if they can. Former partners
                        in the job mast, if necessary, abandon their policy, and no longer continue
                        in close touch with the work or the staff, or the whole change becomes a
                        farce. The present army of secretaries must be rather a difficulty.
                        Personality rather than utility often governs these very necessary or
                        absolutely superfluous positions. The requirements I of the feature are a
                        business secretary and . a private secretary to the general manager, and one
                        to attend to the important and continuous duties of the official meeting*.
                        The first of these is not to be found in Egypt nor easy to find anywhere. If
                        he is not good enough to “dry nurse” or to carry on in a temporary
                        emergency, some one else is wanted between him and the general manager. The
                        commissioners have said that six-wheeled coaches rid$</p>
                    <p>rough. Verb. tap. The fact has to be boldly fired that the shears have to be
                        applied not only to individuals, but to bodies of them, * h. accumulations
                        of time, ^and job*, and the r««t We trust that it is decided to treat all,
                        ant deserving cases in particular, with liberality We hope to see present
                        incumbent* used ups far as is compatible with the object in visa but beyond
                        these limits feelings must not gc Efficiency is to be the sole object and it
                        must be secured from the tea^, and not attempts! rom the heart. In this view
                        we symposia with Major Johnstone in his new position wit] bis old staff, but
                        no one will more readily se he duty before him, .and the danger of delta in
                        hesitations. He require* the support of all He has earned it, and the task
                        is not of his own making.</p>
                    <p>One word as to the cost of all this. .It must involve a big sum of money as
                        compensation The whole of it can be made and saved in year's working of the
                        railways. If we are correctly informed, the Audit and Account department has
                        been undertaken in the wriggle spirit Major Johnstone's bands have here ui
                        doubtedly been strengthened by the recommendation of a gentleman outside the
                        regular staff who is known* to possess the necessary experience, but this
                        part of the deed has been doming very thoroughly and justly done, without
                        fear, favor, or affection. May we be able to say I much, in due course, for
                        the rest of the world The railways are undoubtedly to have, we wish we could
                        say have got, — m audit not to be ignored, and the audit should now come
                        forward and justify its exist each by taking its share in the responsibility
                        for what is done or left undone in other depart meats. On the head of this
                        department devolve no light nor pleasant duty. May he, too, have • he
                        necessary courage to perform it. it is a open secret that the engineering
                        department i to have a new chief. Under the circumstances it is well. He has
                        to do or undo great and d»fi cult things. Evidently one of the first is t
                        gather his work together, then he must reduce and reorganise his staff, and
                        after this to “pressing needs” of the railways tau be attended to. The
                        Commission have clearly laid dow the duties of the chief civil engineer of a
                        railway, they have pointed to the excessive st perior staff, the changes
                        needed are bat to clear. We are decidedly of opinion that there deputies
                        (each with an assistant), of whom on would be in the head office, and
                        perhaps “bridge adviser,” is all the permanent stay necessary. The pay and
                        responsibilities ma well be large, compared with those which ex is
                        correspondence be reduced, and increased tin and attention given to work.”
                        With a lot new work some special assistance may be required for a time, and
                        evidently an expert i required to demarcate land, eta, bat the su plus
                        establishment will be large and mix01 The locomotive department is left in
                        the on sent hands. It has escaped criticism by the Commission, but this may
                        not mean this there is no room for internal reform. The on sent is the
                        opportunity for it, and whether i be taken up voluntarily or under pressure,
                        it i not to be lost We should be disappointed t learn that any persuasion is
                        needed.</p>
                    <p>Evidently the new arrangements are base upon undivided responsibility, and
                        beads &lt; departments must feel it, and are evidently t be paid
                        accordingly. But above all things, i the future their Fork must be theirs,
                        over they most have authority, with it they may not part, with other
                        people's work they have no right to interfere excepting on the appointed
                        occasions—the official meetings to which 11 will refer. May they realise
                        their powers 1 well as their responsibilities, and so person their duties
                        that the general manager may b as little worried from below as from above. V
                        have left to the last the all important earning department of the railways.
                        We have mad our recommendation as to this, and we adhere to it The able and
                        distinguished, officers 1 the head of the traffic department have 1 realise
                        that its proper conduct is a very sera thing to the country, is a big lesson
                        to lean and not to be picked up on these isolate railways. Disregard of the
                        fact means the penditnreof time and money in gaining e: perinea which can be
                        bought readily an (at any price) cheaply in comparison. In the and all
                        departments we have a right to expect that economy be combined with
                        efficiency, an that proper arrangements be made for and continuous
                        supervision. We have 1 above to the institution of official It is on these

                    </p>
                    <p>The distance that divides the stage from the concert-hail is a subject on
                        which operatic artistes are apt to filler widely. While some assume a staid
                        and reserved deportment before a concert audienc, others' endeavour in a
                        certain measure to replace the platform by the “boarus,’ and to this latter
                        category belongs Mr. c. Nicolaou, whose concert last night at the New
                        Kuedivial Hotel was very well at timed. We are lar from considering that a
                        display ot Mr. Nieoiaou's histrionic was aecia when interpreting what, with
                        a few exceptions,</p>
                    <p>" was an operatic programme ; but it must be borne in mind that, in a
                        concert, such talent is of secondary importance and must not be allowed to
                        serve as a blind to the rendering ol music jjtr >Y. Mr. Nicolaou is the
                        possessor ol a tine poweilul voice,capable of tilling any opera house. He
                        cannot theretore but have undergone some dilliculty in reducing it to the
                        compass ol a comparatively small concert-room, and tbis caused us to teel
                        that we were deprived ot appreciating bis accomplishments to their tull
                        extent. Ills programme, as we have said, was largely operatic, and opened
                        with a "Graud Air,” Irom Verdi s ihn Carlost ib which he was satisfactory,
                        hut if anyUiiug insuthciently melodious. His reudenug of FalstalFs
                        “Air’lrumThomas’s Midsummer Sight's Dream was vigorous though a trifle hard.
                        The Drinking Bong from Bizet s Fair Jlaid of Perth showed Mr. Nicolaou to
                        lar better advantage and was a spirited performance. Tbis was followed by
                        thebeuuliful “Stances a JLakunT ol Delibes, in which he struck us a«
                        somewhat unconvincing. Mr. Nicolaou was decidedly at his best in his
                        interpretation of Handel’s “War Bong" from the oratorio founded ou Dryden’s
                        “Alex andor’s Feast.” Here his commanding bau- tono luund tto lull scope,
                        while his bass notes were truly excellent, and he may be said to have well
                        lulhlled P. Gevaert’s dicta*(inserted iu the progtamme) as to the vocal
                        requirements for the production of this work. Mr. Nico- laou’s manner of
                        singing the “Ballata del Pischio” from Boito’s Mejistofele was properly
                        gruesome, while Mepbisiophelea’Bcreuade Irom Gounod's Faust was given with
                        much eclat. Iu the ‘ Air’’ from the Suets de Figaro of Mozart, he was less
                        happy, but thoroughly captivated the bulk of his audience by stirring their
                        national spirits with several Greek melodies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nicolaou was assisted in his concert by the violin solos of Mr.
                        Afeudoulis, who was ably accompanuied by Mmo. Foscolo; be played with great
                        ease aud correctness, if somewhat lacking in verve and sentiment. The “Airs
                        Hougrois” ol Tinudelli were well given ; but of Tschaikowsky’s ditficult
                        “Canzonetta" he proved himself thoroughly master and quite carried aw*y his
                        audience. In Neruda’s “Berceuse Blave”a wanton sympathy was noticeable, but
                        the performance left otherwise nothing to be desired. Mr. Felix’s pianoforte

                    <p>Cairo Railway Station.—Electro pneumatic signalling lias been contracted fur
                        at this station ; but it would, iu the opinion of the Railway Commission, be
                        desirable to postpoue this work until a more definite aud comprehensive plan
                        for the laying out ol tbe whole of the lines in Cairo station and sidiugs
                        has been decided upon. No estimate or plan for this had been furnished to
                        the Comiuis*iou, but with the primitive conditiou of the signalling in all
                        other parts of Egypt, they think that this electro-pueumatic signalling can
                        hardly be necessary.</p>

                        to the present day. Tho exhibition will synchronise with the assembling of

                        next. All tie Arab tribes and all the great African chieftains, Algerian,

                        periods of Persia, Syria, and the Hispano-Mauresque will be represented
                        inevery branch of art work. In other words, every cen tury of Arab work, in

                            <p>The events were interesting and in many cases extremely amusing, the
                                hat-trimming and house-keeping competitions being perhaps the best.
                                The Affinity Stakes were easily wou by Capt the Hon. A. Stanley and
                                Miss Hurley from 10 other competitors, while the D&amp;k Race Was a
                                hollow victory for Mr. Langley. The hat-trimming competition was
                                greatly enjoyed, the incogruity of the hats, —and very pretty many
                                oj them were—held on by male riders going at full gallop being quite
                                comic. The House-keeping Stakes revealed a sad absence of the higher
                                ma^uematios among the ladies, who mostly succumbed to the fatal
                                problem of the “herring and &amp; half that cost 1} piastres,” aud
                                of whom oue only gave her companion a oorreot answer. The last event
                                was very interesting, Capt and Mrs. Bay ley and the Hon. A. Stanley,
                                with Mins Hurloy, giving a very good display of riding.</p>

                                <item>Morice winning from Mr. E. P. Blenoowe after a capital game.
                                    Both players were troubled throughout by the strong glare and
                                    the keenness of the ““greens.” The game opened cautiously, play
                                    being unexoitiug for the first 2 holes. A fine iron shot out of
                                    a dusty lie enabled Morice to claim the lead at the 3rd hole.
                                    This he quickly iucreased, winning’ the 5th and 6th by correct
                                    play, Bleocowe’s tee shots running wild At the 7th both drove
                                    well over the rails, but Morice was all at sea in the short game
                                    and lost the hole comfortably. The 8ih was halved by untidy
                                    golf; Blencowe overran his pitch at the 9th aud Morice turned 3
                                    up. He increased his lead to 4 up at the 10th, where he rattled
                                    iu a fine put for 3. A poor tee shot at the next hole found
                                    Morice in the sand, and Blencowe, making no mistake, reduced the
                                    lead to 3. Morice hit a big shot off the 12th tee and went ahead
                                    again, and after correct 4*s at the 13th, the match ended on the
                                    14th green, where Morice found his iron shot within 6 ft. of the
                                    hole with "2 for the cup.”</item>

                    <p>Price Aziz Pasha Hassau has returned to Alexandria from Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Sir F. R Wingate Pasha, Governor General of the Sudan, is expected at Cairo
                        on Monday from Suakin.</p>
                    <p>Our Luxor Correspondent states that the ex-Empress Engeuie has arrived there
                        on her way back from Khartoum, and will stay at Luxor for a few days before
                        returning to Casio.</p>
                    <p>An interesting story is told by "M.A.P.” of the last visit of the Empress to
                        Egypt:— When she last visited Cairo she was in the enjoy mentally that the
                        world could give, beauty of a rare type, admired by ail, a happy wife, a
                        proud mother, a throne which she gracefully' occupied. It was at Cairo that
                        she heard of a celebrated Dervish, and determined to consult him. Thickly
                        veiled and diqpieed, she went, accompanied by oue ol her ladies in
                        attendance, to see him. On entering his abode the Dervish rose, made a low
                        obeisance, and addressed her thus : “Weloome, you are thrice welcome’ to my
                        humble dwelling, oh, Effipress I* Eugenie, vexed and astonished, replied,
                        "How do you know that I am an Empress, and who told you I was ooming here V’
                        The Dervish answered: “The stars and Mohamed know everything. I knew since
                        your arrival in Egypt that you would come to ‘ me, and L have patiently
                        waited every night, for afterwards I am commanded by Allah to make my last
                        journey to Mecoa and die.”</p>
                    <p>Tbe Empress, very frightened, was getting up to leave, for she began to fear
                        this mysterious man, but, summoning courage, she said, in a haughty tone:
                        "It is true that I am * the Empress, though no one knows it but my
                        attendant; tell me what you can'of my future, tell me all, and tell me
                        truly,” at the same time offering him her hand, and showing him the palm to
                        examine ; but the old seer never touched her jewelled fingers. Raising
                        himself to his full height, and dropping his staff, he held his hand aloft
                        as in invocation to Allah. Looking down piteously on the dark figure of the
                        Empress, he murmured slowly, “There is no God but God and Mohamed is His
                        Prophet At yourbirth tbe stars foretold for you great powe and greater
                        sorrow, for your happiness will only be temporary, but your sorrow will last
                        for ever. You are doomed to lose your throne, your husband, and your son,
                        and, wander alone through the world like a lost star." ,</p>
                    <p>““These events will not happen' at once, for the blow would kill you. To ypu
                        as an Empress it will not be permitted to enter the Land of your husband or
                        son, exoept by permission of those you despise. You will have to seek a home
                        with strangers, and the dress of woe will never leave your form; your jewels
                        will be but tear drops. I have said.” He had scarcely ceased speaking when
                        the Empress, terrified and angry, threw at his feet a purse of gold, crying
                        out: “You base impostor, take the fruit and reward ot your liea and let me
                        out of your den.’’Then, rushing hurriedly out, she ran swiftly away. This
                        strange and unhappy prediction was made n 1869 ; how literally it has been
                        fulfilled, events have proved.</p>
