            <div type="article">
                <head>The Situation</head>
                <p> The telegrams both from St. Petersburg and Tokio show that the battle has by no
                    means ended, and that the theatre of the great fight has merely been moved from
                    Mukden to the north of Tieling, where another furios struggle is proceeding.
                    Kuropatkin proved his genius for retreat both at Liao-yang and at the Sha-ho,
                    but he has not shown that he can make use of the greatest opportunity for the
                    display of that genius that the war has yet</p>
                <cols n="6"/>
                <cb n="6"/>
                <p>given him. For eighteen days this stupendous battle has been raging and roaring
                    in Man-churia. For eighteen days the Japanese armies have been patiently and
                    relentlessly pushing forward to the consummation of a careful plan, for eighteen
                    days the Russian forces have been obstinately contesting every inch of hard won
                    ground with the dogged and obstinate cou-rage of men who do not recognise
                    defeat. If Kuropatkin suceeds once more in ex-tricating any considerable part of
                    his army and impedimenta from the battle now raging north of Tieling, the end
                    will not have been attained, and the terrible sacrifice will not have secured
                    the object for which so a high a price has been paid. That even-tuality seems
                    more and more improbable. To all seeming this must be of the campaign whether
                    Kuropatkin capitulates, or breaks through with a handful, a remnant, of his once
                    great and powerful army. But if he succeeds in pushing direct northwards from
                    Tieling, as he pushed on last week aganist terrific odds from Mukden to Tieling
                    he will have accomplished a feat surpassing in skill any yet achieved by a
                    beaton general.</p>
                <p>A telegram, despatched from Tokio yester-day, announces that the Japanese
                    occupied Sing-king on the 13th inst. Sing-king, like Fu-shun, is a small town
                    with a wall a third of a mile long surrounding it. Sing-king's height above the
                    sea is fourteen hundred feet, and this will afford an idea of the fall of the
                    country towards Mukden. To reach Sing-king from the Yalu, as he new Ja-panese
                    Army has done, the Chang-chung-ling, or Serpent Pass, eighteen miles to the
                    south-west, has to be traversed, where the height is 2,300ft above sea level, it
                    being the highest point on the road from Sing-king to Liao-yang. On the north
                    side of this pass rises the Shu-tsu (which joins the Hun-ho at Ying-pan), and on
                    the south side the Tai-tse-sho. The difficulties attending the passage of an
                    army through very hilly country are not few even under normal conditions, and it
                    will be easy to com-prehend that the hopes which the Russians entertain of being
                    able to conduct the strate-gies retirement of their left successfully through
                    such a region, with the Japanese close on heels and on both flanks as well, must
                    be sl indeed. The Japanese army which has occ Sing-king consists of more than
                    six sions of territorial troops under. General Kawamura, and this magnificent
                    force, which by this time may have reached Ying Pan will afford a further line
                    of resistance to any attempt of the remnants of Linievitch's army to retire on
                    the East, assuming that army is still existing as a military entity, which is
                    doubtful.</p>
                <p>Our telegrams contain the important news that a Japanese fleet left Singapore for
                    an unknown destination, but it is believed that it is ready to cross the Indian
                    Ocean. This fleet consists of 22 men-of-war. Meanwhile, Rodjestvensky's Baltic
                    Fleet has gone to Djibouti to meet the third Squadron, which is due to pass
                    through the Suez Canal next week. It must be remembered that, in spite of her
                    wonderful achievements, Japan still depends for her success upon her retention
                    of the command of the sea. That command, once it passes to Russia, will
                    ultimatley render almost fruitless the whole of the japanese victories on land.
                    Her island kingdom will no longer form as at present an impregnable base from
                    which to supply her armies in Manchuria, nor with her still relatively small
                    fleet has she the reserves upon which to fall back in the event of an exhaustive
                    or indecisive naval battle with the Baltic Fleet. In short, a "stale-mate" would
                    in present circumstances go far to neutralise the successes she has hiterto won.
                    The departure therefore of the fleet from Singapore shows that the Japanese hold
                    that no settles peace is in sight until the Russian Navy as well as the Army, is
                    distinctly and undoubtedly worsted in the fight</p>
