                        reasonable classes in Germany would realise that it is their naval 
                        programme which is almost entirely responsible for the feeling 
                        against that country which undoubtedly exists among us to-day. 
                        There is nothing in England of that furious hatred which raged 
                        through the Fatherland during the Boer War. Even to this day the 
                        ordinary Englishman has not recovered from the shook of surprise 
                        with which he learned how the Germans disliked and loathed us, 
                        and to what gross excesses they were allowed to proceed. That 
                        loathing has no counterpart in England, nor is it likely that 
                        it ever will have. We are too unimaginative a people even now 
                        to understand why Germany suddenly went mad over a war which was 
                        no concern of theirs, and could at the highest only affect the 
                        wildest dreams of the Pan Germanic fanatics. We harbour no feelings 
                        of aggression against Germany, as Coant von Bulow knows. He is well 
                        aware that oar Parliamentary institutions and our free demo* 
                        eratioc Government constitute an absolute barrier to the formation 
                        of offensive sohemes, and that our diplomacy is characterised by 
                        only too obvious a desire to bend before the passing storm. We have 
                        been driven much against our will to regard the sayings and doings 
                        of our neighbours with deep suspicion. And so long as the increase 
                        of the German Naval Estimates is ostentatiously directed against 
                        England, there is little chance that pacificatory speeches at mass 
                        meetings will allay our feelings of deep-rooted apprehension.</p>

                    <head>GAMBLING IN HAW COTTON.</head>
                    <p>The exhaustive address delivered by Mr. Balfour at the meeting of 
                        the British Cotton Growing Association yesterday week should be 
                        of great service in concentrating public attention on the only 
                        real preventive of gambling in raw cotton. That evil accompaniment 
                        of the great Lancashire industry is consequent on two causes, 
                        operating together. The one is the continuously increasing demand 
                        of the world for the commodity, without corresponding augmentation 
                        of the Supply ; the second governing factor is the uncertainty of 
                        the amount likely to be available for the outside world out of the 
                        American crop. Only the other day, the price suddenly advanced by 
                        more than 50 per oent solely because of the growing probability 
                        that the American surplus would be considerably less than had been
                        previously estimated. With such fluctuations in market values of 
                        constant occurrence, gambling for the rise or the fall is 
                        inevitable, and Mr. Balfour does well to discountenance any 
                        expectations of legislative remedies. Bat there is, hapily, 
                        another way of rendering the New Orleans and Chicago rings 
                        comparatively ineffective. In the case of cereals, every attempt, 
                        however heavily capitalised, to maintain an artificial level of 
                        prices has terminated in the financial collapse of its promoters 
                        ; it was impossible, they discovered, to “corner” sou roes of 
                        supply spread all over the world. And it will be equally difficult 
                        to engineer forestalling operations in raw cotton when it is 
                        produced in all of those portions of oar Empire where the soil 
                        and climate are congenial. That gigantic work is undertaken by 
                        the British Cotton-Growing Association, and the quick progress 
                        already made in West Africa and other tropical parts of Greater 
                        Britain renders it almost certain that in the course of a few 
                        years Lancashire will be much better secured from having her 
                        working population reduced to semi-starvation by Transatlantic or 
                        home gamblers.</p>

                            banks at the time the oompany was formed, but only on reoeiving the
                            aaaursnoe that the Greek element should have the preponderance in the
                            oonduot and direction of business transactions. Difficulties arose,
                            however, from the aotion of the Na'ionalbank fur Deutschland in seeking
                            to infiaenoe the seleo- 'ion of the personnel of the governing board,
                            and so interfering with the unity and promp- titude of its so*ion, and
                            that in the interest of the German element — a courte of aotion whioh
                            the Greek National Bank naturally opposed...”</p>
                        <p>The solution of the difficulty now proposed is that the Banque d’Orient
                            should be left en- tirely to the management of the Athenian board, on
                            wbioh Greek preponderance should be assure!. The Binque d’O isnt would
                            retain its branches in Smyrna, Salonika, Alexandria and Cairo, while the
                            branches in Constantinople and Hamburg would be handed over to the
                            National bank file Deutschland for further oession to the Deutsche

                            announced yesterday, oaused a great sensa- tion. The timely assistanoe
                            of the allied banks, however, has completely restored oonfidenoe. After
                            a short but sharp panic, prices are dosing near Saturday’s level. Jnited
                            Copper broke twenty points, but rallied afterwards. AU John Walsh's
                            enter- prises have been taken over by the allied banks.</p>

                            whioh J attended yesterday. The rooms had been moat tastefully deoorated
                            and the manner in wbioh the several stalls had been laid out was quite
                            artistic.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, Lady Cromer wee unable to * attend, and her abaseoe was
                            greatly felt, but drs. Bollock very kindly consented to open the sale.
                            The oeremony commenced with a short prayer by the Very Rev Dean Butoher,
                            ).D., who also made an excellent speech in * which, after expressing the
                            general regret alt at the absence of Lady Cromer and the gratitude of
                            the oommittee to Mrs. Bullook for filling the gap thus oaused, he gave a

                            in Bgjrpt- In I* a few well-chosen words Mrs Bollock declared the sale
                            open, and after a vote of thanks to dra. Bullook had been moved by
                            Crookshauk ’*»ha and oarried with aoolamation, the stalls c were
                            surrounded by reedy purchasers.</p>
                        <p>The principal stalls were the English stall, consisting ohiefly of
                            children’s garments, end presided over by Mrs. Alban, Mrs. Bullook. irs.
                            Botcher, and the Hon. Mrs. Davey ; the i lootoh stall, with woollen
                            goods, presided over by Lady Rogers, Lady Willoooka, Mm. Graham, and
                            Mrs. L’Eetrange Johnstone; the Irish stall, with li^en goods, presided .
                            over by Mrs. Johnson Pasha, Mrs. Milward. and Mrs. Trevithiok ; the
                            American stall, with 1 cakes and sweets, presided over by Mm Crookshank
                            Pasha and Mrs. Btoct ; aed the Continental stall, presided over by Mrs.
                            looker and Mme. Fabrioius Pasha. Besides the*e there were the Connaught
                            House stall, eavily laden with London goods, end a ohil- . drop’s stall
                            on whioh toys, dolls, and books abounded, and the tee-room, when refresh
                            ; rnenta were served at a moderate prioa, was well-patronised.</p>
                        <p>Want of space prevents os describing the various stalls and their burdens
                            in detail, but eaoh reflected great oredit on those who were responsible
                            for their arrangement, and what is more important, each was well
                            patronised, and at the dose of the evening their bnrdens were
                            considerably lighter. Should the second day prove as sncoessfal as
                            yesterday the organising oommittee will be able to con- gratnlate
                            themselves on the ample manner in whioh their efforts have been repaid.
                            We should imagine, however, that snoceu, such as is their due, is
                            already assured, for, although ' we have no idea of yesterday’s takings,
                            they must be considerable if all those who were present did their duty.

                            ooourred,” aeys the much vexed for the accusation thrown on his
                            compatriots "Egyptian Patriot" Allow me, please, to oootradiot The
                            incident between the two Greeks, of the loweet-olaae, whioh had as a
                            oonseqnebee the wounding of the native, cannot be the sole reason of
                            Sanday’s riot for a man who has a bit of common sense. Many inch

                            oonseqnenoes as those of Snnday’a last. Should the natives, of low-
                            class, not be injured by the lest (holy) speeobes of the sheikhs and the
                            disonssion in the street of the "Hub el Diana’’ (Holy War), no men sen

                            numerous.</p>
                        <p>The "Egyptian Patriot” seems—against his g kssnmnoe—inspired by his

                            not mention in his letter, that the Mixed Courts should be entitled with
                            right to diaanse the Greek rondents—end only the Greek residents—as if

                        <p>In an article under the heading of 1 "Developments in the Sudan,” the
                            City editor cf the "Standard” says: With the opening of the Sudan
                            Railway shortly by Lord Cromer, a most important step will have been
                            taken in the direction of developing the resonroee of the
                            Sudanandinorsasing the oommeroialimportance of Khartonm. Only a few
                            years ago the oost and abonr of oonveyanoe between Egypt and the la dan
                            was heavy and wearisome, the Nile route having to be followed, with the
                            alter- native of the no less arduous though some- what shorter journey
                            by oamel from Snakin, vift Berber, while, even in recent times, the jour
                            ey from Cairo to Khartonm has taken something like foor days, with
                            almost daily transfers from one kind of oonveyanoe to another. Now,
                            however, the mode of transit will be comparatively rapid and simple, and
                            some id— of the shortening of the distanoe may be gathered from the faot
                            that after the open- ing of the new railway, Kh\rtonm will he within
                            eight days’ journey of London. With these improved facilities there will
                            naturally be a groat redaction in the freight ohaiges, and it is felt
                            that a considerable and important impetus it about to be given to trade
                            and to business with the Sndan. The whole of the oountry is extremely
                            fertile, and, with that attention that the Government of the Sndan
                            intends to devots to irrigation, the prospects ahead appear te be meet
                            promising, and al- ready have had a considerable influence upon the
                            value of land round about Khartonm, prices of bnilding sit— in the city
                            within the past six months having risen anything between 100 and 500 par
                            cent 1 n view of the recant over specula- tion in Egyptian land, it may
                            be hoped that future prospects in t ha Sndan will not be too promptly

                        <p>The following are some extracts from the speech of Sheikh Cherif at the
                            distribntion of grants-in-eid on Snnday last</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen,—Yon are aware that the qnes- tion of the improvement of the
                            exi-ting knttabs and the oreation of new institutions of this class has
                            long ooonpied the minds and formed the snbjeot of the discussions of
                            Egyptians, This is explained by the fact that the knttabe are the only
                            means for the propagation of elementary ednoation in Egypt, and the ne-
                            oessary base for all superior education and instruction, whioh are
                            indispensable for the improvement of the nation and its assured
                            prosperity. The Government, being preooon- pied with the interest of the
                            country, is taking aotive steps for the improvement of these schools.
                            The inhabitants of the oonntry have been qniok to understand the objeot
                            of the State’s endeavours, and a general movement is on foot to seoond
                            them. Egyptians realise the absolute neoeseity tor the propagation of
                            instruction and ednoation in an epooh in whioh it has beoome impossible
                            for men to remain in ignoranoe and darkness.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry of Pnblio Instruction, repre- Mating the Government in all
                            that oonoerns education, has considered it beat to pursue its endeavours
                            toward this end in a regular and gradoal manner to aeonre good results,
                            and has resolved so to continue them, what- ever obstacles it may
                            enoonnter. The Wakf knttabs, whioh are not numerous, have assnr- ed
                            resources, and oannot be abolished, are the first that have teen taken
                            in hand. After nomerons difficulties a satisfactory resalt has been
                            arrived at in the oaee of these schools, and the Ministry has tin— tamed
                            its atten- tion to the free knttabs. In spite of obsta- alee it has been
                            able to attract more than half ef these institutions which have
                            submitted to be inspected by the Ministry, obtaining a money grant paid
                            yearly to the most de- serving. </p>
                        <p>Since the application of throe measures, i.e., siuoi 1898, certain
                            important measures have been taken of whioh the following are the
                            chief:— ’ </p>
                        <p>1. The yearly increase of the Bndget for the knttabs. 2. The inorease of
                            the number of inspeotors and snb-inspeotors, of whom there are now 81.
                            3. The inorease in the nnmber of the hours in the normal onnionlnm of
                            the Government schools and knttabs eaoh Thursday and Friday to oomplete
                            the training of.the knttab teachers. 4. The foundation of normal schools
                            for male and female teachers in the knttabs. In two years three schools
                            of this sort have been founded, whioh now train 18 i male and 40 female
                            students. ‘ * 5. The institution of annual examinations bo test the
                            professional capabilities of fikis and arils. 6. —The elaboration of
                            programmes, regula- tions, and roles for the organisation and discipline
                            of the knttabs and the normal sohools......... Despite the short time
                            that has elapsed since the adoption of these measures, their application
                            nnder the control of the Ministry has given, notably this year, remark-
                            able results, as the following facts indicate :—</p>
                        <p>(1).—The nnmber, which increases very year, of knttab wakia and free
                            knttabs that plaoe themselves under the oontrol of the Ministry. The
                            former nnmber 109, with 194 male and 17 female teaohers, the latter
                            4,859, with 6,395 mala teaohers and 33 school mistresses.</p>
                        <p>(2).—The development of the training of teaohers for the knttabs, whioh
                            has made speoial progress siooe the institution of teach- ing oonrses
                            and the foundation of normal sohools. To this development the excellent
                            results of the examination of fikis and arifii last August are
                            das............................ The most satisfactory feature is this,
                            that the majority of those who passed the examine- tions have obtained
                            plaoaa as teaohers. Some, having clearly understood the objeot of thair
                            training at the sohools where they were pre- pared for the examination,
                            preferred to open knttabs themselves rather than aoospt the offer them
                            of employment in existing knttabs.</p>
                        <p>(3). The knttabs under the oontrol of the Mioiatry have made real
                            progress in manage- ment,raligioaa instruction,and in instr otion in
                            other matters, as is proved by(a)the inorease of papila, especially of
                            girls, in the— knttabs. ... (b) by the yearly inowase in (be numbers ot
                            kattafas that deserve e subvention. There are at proa—t 517 first-class
                            knttabe in receipt of grants amounting to LB. 5,098.430 milL and 2,148
                            of the seoond olaas reoeiving grants amounting to LB. 8,185.800
                            mill....(c) The nnmber of advanoed pupils increases every year in tiro—
                            knttabs, — will be shown by statistics shortly, to be published. I hast—
                            to say here that the teaohing of the Kona and of religions prinoip'oa is
                            the objeot of porti- on]— can on the past of the Ministry. The
                            statistics of knttab pnpils learning the Koran by heart give
                            figures..which show that the arrangements of the Ministry are favorable
                            to the learning of the Koran.</p>
                        <p>With the aid of the Ministry of Finance the , Ministry of Public
                            Instruction attempted an important reform which is intimately connected
                            with the improvement of the knttabe. This reform consisted of giving
                            elementary in- dustrial training to certain pupils of the kuttabe with a
                            view to develop the test for professional occupations and to make the
                            people understand that the instruction given in the kuttabe is
                            indispensable for the young <cb n="6"/> both for the aooomplishment of
                            their religious duties and tor the needs of daily life. The H experiment
                            all but failed last year. Bnt the KB attempt has been renewed this yeir.
                            The H Ministry has entered nto an understanding pB with the head of the
                            model workshops at IJj Boulao to the effeot th»t the apprentices of
                            these workshops ere to be chosen from H amoDg the pupils of the Wakf
                            kuttabe.</p>
                        <p>While the Ministry worked to obtain these excellent results it attempted
                            to improve theB knttabs themselves, which were in an in- desoribable
                            state of dilapidation. Bat in view of its moderate resoaroes all that
                            oonld be done under this head was the minimum of repair necessary to
                            preserve the buildings. The real need was their reoonstrnotion, which
                            demanded earns whioh the Ministry was never likely to dispose of. Thns
                            the que-tion of im- proving the sohoolhonses appeared to pres—t an
                            inanrmoantable obstacle, when, at ri»« most critical point, by a
                            providential chanoe, the Wakfs Administration, happily inspired by the
                            goodwill of its direotor, H. E. Abd el Hamil Pasha Assam, came to the
                            aid of the Ministry by m«king an annnal inorease of L B 6,000 in its
                            budget for the improvement of these knttabs and particularly of the
                            kuttab buildings. The Ministry has set apart this year the sum of LE.
                            5,000 lor the construction of six new knttabs, three in Oairo and three
                            in the provinces, and for the repair of 11 knttabs in Cairo. It will be
                            in a position to reconstruct gradually every knttab whioh requires
                            repair.... At the same time the public, which clearly realised the
                            objeot of this improvement of the kuttabe and has grasped the neoeseity
                            of the oombination of all classes in developing instruction, has set to
                            work in every part of Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Everywhere buildings suitable for kuttabs are being constructed, some by
                            individuals, some by subscription, especially since the Government has
                            decided to give free grants of land for the construction of kuttabs. Up
                            to date 758 suitable buildings have been con- structed and 187 others
                            are in course of construction. Local oommittees have been formed for the
                            improvement and extension of ednoation and have oolleoted considerable
                            sums for the purpose. </p>
                        <p>The best method of insuring tint these buildings shall always be nsed at
                            kattafas, Le., at soholastio establishments where teaching is given
                            exclusively in Arabic and includes the Koran, religions instruction,
                            caligraphy, ele- mentary arithmetic, etc, is to make buildings wakfs,
                            and qua wakfs, to endow them with property sufficient to ensure their
                            main- tenance continuance in perpetuity. Let us hope that the notables
                            of the country will grasp the advantages of this course and hasten to
                            adopt it By so doing they will give proofs of their foresight and of
                            their zeal in sustaining the dearest interests of the nation.</p>

                    <p>St. Petersburg, December 18.</p>
                    <p>The Tsar has sanctioned a stringent penal ordinance for the prevention 
                       of railway and telegraph strikes. At the same time the pay of telegraphists 
                       and a section of railwaymen has been increased. The telegraph strike is 
                       collapsing, except in the Baltic provinces, which remain in a state of chaos.</p>
                    <p>An official communique dwells on the activity of the extreme revolutionary 
                       parties and adds that in the struggle with them the Government still 
                       relies on existing laws and ordinances, but if these fail, absolutely 
                       exceptional measures will become necessary. (ft.)</p>

                    <p>The workmen’s delegates were arrested on account of a manifesto ordering the 
                       people to refuse to pay taxes and other dues, declaring that no debts contracted 
                       by the Government since it began warring against the nation should be 
                       recognised. Eight newspapers have been suppressed for publishing this manifesto.</p>

                    <p>Shanghai, December 18.</p>
                    <p>Rioting has taken place here. The German Consul was struck by a stone, and the 
                        American vice-consul was wounded, as well as several Europeans. The warships 
                        are disembarking men, and the volunteers are being called out.</p>
                    <p>Later.</p>
                    <p>The police aided by tailors and volunteers have repressed the riot. A police 
                        station was burnt. A score of Chinese rioters were killed. It is believed 
                        that no European has been killed although there are several wounded.</p>

                    <head>THE EMANCIPATION OF EGYPT</head>
                    <p>"Oh wad some power the giftie gie us To see ourselves as others see us."</p>
                    <p>Whatever else the modern Egyptian may have to complain about, he cannot 
                        well say that the opportunity asked for in the above quotation has been 
                        denied to him ; in recent times there has certainly been no lack of books 
                        written for his edification. There must be something peculiar in the North 
                        African climate, which makes it so difficult for a person to travel from 
                        the coast to the cataracts without succumbing to the apparently irresistible 
                        attraction of rushing into print.</p>
                    <p>A rather remarkable writer, not many years ago, published an essay on 
                        “The decay of the gentle art of lying,” and to this deoay he attributes 
                        the dull monotony of most modern literature. The older books of travel 
                        in Egypt were free from this reproach ; we have lately read one dated 
                        1785 which is well out of range, and many of the much earlier produo tions 
                        may be said to “combine the eloquence of Demosthenes with the inaccuracy 
                        of state* ment of Annanias,” though they were occasionally lacking in the 
                        first element. It sometimes makes ns shudder to see how some modern 
                        writers will bald up an airy fabric based on the slender foundation of 
                        some old traveller, and then expect us to believe that such things were so.</p>
                    <p>To those of our readers whose bookshelves may be over-full of the class of 
                        literature we have just referred to, we still recommend that a place should 
                        be found for the book now under review, for it is a remarkable work, 
                        although its author is so modest that we only know that it is translated 
                        from the Italian into exceedingly good English, by another equally unknown 
                        person. He takes for his preface a well-known quotation from Lord Milner’s 
                        “England in Egypt,” and on this text be preaches us, in his earlier pages, 
                        an exceedingly good sermon. From the introductory chapter we quote</p>
                    <p>"He who would really look into the annals of Egypt during the century which has 
                        just closed, and would seriously endeavour to give a clear, fair and accurate 
                        idea of their meaning must keep a cool head. If he dips into the mass of literature, 
                        or tries to master a tithe of the innumerable books and pamphlets, in which the 
                        latter-day history of Egypt has been distorted or caricatured, he will see that 
                        he must struggle hard to avoid being carried off his feet by the tide of wilful 
                        or unintentional prejudice. From the very outset the fair-minded observer must 
                        endeavour to place himself at the right standpoint. This is evidently not any 
                        easy matter for him to do. Most of the literature which is his rough material, 
                        consists in journalistic attempts to blow either the French, English or native 
                        trumpet, regardless of truth or falsehood. Of such books there has been enough, 
                        and more than enough. These passionate partisan outpourings achieve little ; 
                        they advance the interests of none, and least of all those which they profess 
                        to champion.”........</p>
                    <p>“It is the peculiar task of any one investigating Egyptian affairs, that he must 
                        take into consideration not only a complex native civilisation, as far as that 
                        exists,but at the same time seek to understand that heterogeneous concourse of 
                        strangers from every clime, which has congregated about the banks of the Nile ; 
                        and moreover, he must take into account the considerable interests in Egypt of 
                        Turkey, France, and England, of Germany and Italy, of Austria and Belgium, and 
                        in a lesser degree of other European nations.”</p>
                    <p>“The student viewing Egyptian history of the nineteenth century is confronted 
                        with almost insuperable difficulties. His authorities are, as often as not, 
                        in violent contradiction. But that is far from being the worst. Much more 
                        misleading, much less easy of refutation, are the half-truths of which these 
                        chroniclers are so fond. It needs unusual powers of insight and a rare faculty 
                        for weighing testimony and balancing probabilities, to unravel the tangled 
                        skein. If gifted with a capacity for separating the grain from the chaff, 
                        of discriminating between fact and fiction, and endowed with a penetrative 
                        instinct enabling him to discern what is certainly right, the historian 
                        may be successful in forging for himself a chain of irrefutable trustworthy 
                        evidence. It is thus, and thus only, that he oan thread his way securely in
                        any attempt to foreoast the future___________When we attempt, as we shall 
                        attempt in the present work, to foreshadow, anticipate or suggest the probable 
                        future of Egyptian affairs, or what we consider the future of Egypt should be, 
                        we shall find that our balancing rod needs to be very evenly, very justly 
                        poised, our feet must be planted warily, and our eyes most be undeviatingly 
                        fixed upon the true necessities national as well as international—of Egypt.”</p>
                    <p>Our readers will see from the above, that our author has not approached his 
                        task in any light spirit; he fully appreciates his difficulties, and like an 
                        ancient knight, has armed himself cap a-pie ; he does not plunge suddenly into 
                        the middle of things, but lays siege to them from afar, as we may judge from 
                        the following lines :—</p>
                    <p>"It is but natural that We should begin with a cursory appraisement of French 
                        influence in Egypt. The part played by that country extends farther back than 
                        that of other European powers, and a rapid review of its importance since 1798
                        presents no considerable difficulty,” etc.</p>
                    <p>‘The Egyptian civilisation of to-day is French almost to the backbone.”</p>
                    <p>“The reforms introduced by Mohamed Aly and his dynasty were carried out, if 
                        not exclusively , at least for the most part,by Frenchmen....... The irrigation
                        Schemes to which Egypt owes half of its present-day prosperity were inaugurated 
                        by the French. The whole idea of Nile barrages and dams is French; and,</p>
                <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>albeit finally carried out by British enterprise, the attempts which paved the 
                        way to these broader designs, and which were in themselves anything bnt 
                        contemptible, were French in their inception.”</p>
                    <p>We are not quite of this opinion and there might be a good deal to say about 
                        this, for the modern system of irrigation and dame carried out by British 
                        engineers have very little to do with the schemes projected and partly carried 
                        out previous to 1884 ; had this not been so the present state of Egypt would not 
                        have been attained. Although this is an important subject we do not wish to divert 
                        our readers’ attention by developing it at present, we merely note it as a 
                        rather weak point in our author’s armour.</p>
                    <p>He goes on to say : “The educational system is thoroughly French; and through 
                        the schools, the language of France has spread until it may be said without 
                        fear of contradiction that French is still the predominant European language 
                        of that land of innumerable tongues. French is the tongue generally affected 
                        by the upper classes, and perhaps a striking and not generally known illustration 
                        of how French has sunk into the very soul of the country, is that it is even 
                        used by British officials in their official reports—yet another anomaly in 
                        this home of anomalies.”</p>
                    <p>This is another point we do not wish to discuss at present, but Would merely 
                        remark that the book we are reviewing is dated 1905 ; that for a long time 
                        past we have heard of some 50 British professors or teachers at Egyptian 
                        Government schools, and we are under the impression that they were not brought 
                        out to this country to teach French only. It looks as though our another were 
                        again a little off his guard.</p>
                    <p>“We see what the influence of France has been ;—we need not trace the changeful 
                        phases of French policy in Egypt, or discuss the alternating attitude adopted by 
                        successive French ministers. It is at present immaterial to us whether the conduct 
                        of de Freycinet was inopportune, dilatory, or precipitate, and it will be more 
                        to the point to treat French policy towards Egypt together with our appreciation 
                        of British policy, to which w now proceed.”</p>
                    <p>“If it were possible to read the story of ‘British aggression’ in Egypt as it 
                        has been penned by writers whose implacable hostility to England has rendered 
                        them blind to their own absurdity-; if it were possible to read the story without 
                        at once being provoked to uncontrollable  mirth by the bread humour of its 
                        incongruities; if it were possible for a brief space to become oblivious of all 
                        well-established facts, to make our minds a blank, and to read these writers in 
                        all seriousness ; there are probably few who would rise from the perusal without 
                        a painful conviction that the iniquities of the human race are beyond all hope. 
                        They would besides discover by this assumption, that within the brief period of 
                        little more than a oentary, one little plot of island earth should have produced 
                        a succession of ministers whose diabolic schemes would have raised a blush of 
                        shame on the cheeks of a Machiavelli, or perhaps have caused him a pang of envy 
                        that his principles, which until then had been held to be the most unprincipled 
                        ever yet advanced, should have been out-distanced by a series of not very 
                        remarkable English statesman.”</p>
                    <p>“Supposing the reader had thus far missed the humour of the tale, he would ba 
                        set still farther wondering when he came to observe that these self-same 
                        statesmen had not overstepped the customary limits of diplomatic guile in their 
                        manifold dealings with the rest of the world. AU their diabolical cunning had been
                        visited upon poor Egypt. At this point, probably the most credulous of readers would 
                        begin to see that he was being mystified . It is our duty to point out that there 
                        is no justification whatever for the statement that England has carried oat a 
                        long-meditated Machiavellian policy with regard to Egypt. We shall show that England 
                        has not taken more advantage of the weak position of Egypt than any other country has 
                        taken of its weaker neighbours, and that whether England’s interference in Egypt has 
                        been beneficial to that oountry or not—a point on which we shall at a later stage 
                        enlarge — that interference has been justifiable, and, indeed, for England a matter 
                        of imperial life or death. AU that we would point out is that, from that moment 
                        (i.e. when England took India)Egypt was inevitably destined to figure as an important 
                        factor in British policy."</p>
                    <p>“We have not to justify the English footing in India, but once that footing 
                        established; England could not contemplate with equanimity the presence of a 
                        powerful enemy, or Even a potential adversary, astride the closest line of 
                        communication with India...... A strong hand in Egypt which was not her own she 
                        could not tolerate.”</p>
                    <p>'It is the consistency of British foreign policy which has been misinterpreted 
                        as Machiavellianism ; because England has often been able to play a waiting game, 
                        she has often been credited with a subtlety, to which in reality she has no claim.”</p>
                    <p>“Neither Germany nor France can venture to despatch a couple of hundred thousand 
                        men or even a far less number, over seas,. without perilously impairing its internal
                        equilibrium. The French expedition to Mexico can without exaggeration be set down 
                        as-paid for at the price of Metz and Sedan.”</p>
                    <p>“ By a series of political moves (some costing blood, some much diplomatic effort) 
                        land has thus far succeeded in scaring away all her dangerous rivals from settling 
                        down on the Isthmus of Suez. Was she now, after ridding herself of the first Napoleon
                        and disposing of Mohamed Ali, to allow another powerful monarch to take their place !
                        The whole labour of seventy years would have been utterly wasted."</p>
                    <p>"We need in conclusion to touch but lightly on the last question—the events of</p>
                <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>1882. England has been wildly accused of having in her own interests and for her own ends 
                        fomented the revolt of Arabi Pasha.</p>
                    <p>Prima facie, the whole idea of England having fomented She Arabi affair is highly 
                        improbable; and it remains for the accusers to adduce more cogent evidence than has 
                        yet been forthcoming before the matter can be regarded in a serious light, We must 
                        remember that Seymour’s action before Alexandria took place upon the direct invitation 
                        and with the explicit consent of France, and that up to that date England never acted 
                        without the concurrence of France. ”</p>
                    <p>" It will be very evident that England his' not interpreted her role in any selfish manner,
                        and that the period of British occupation has been one of continually increasing material
                        prosperity. When England first set foot in Egypt, she found the finances in a state of 
                        absolute confusion. To-day the finances of Egypt are in as sound a condition as those of
                        any European state.”</p>
                    <p>The author concludes his brilliant introduction by an able financial statement into
                        which we will not follow him ; the question, though very interesting, is not the one
                        which engages our attention for the moment; under the present regime the finances of
                        Egypt can be trusted to take o=care of themselves.</p>

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                            accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                            they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                            accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                            are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                            things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                            between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                            Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                            than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                            the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                            place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                            sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                            the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>

                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                            London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                            Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                            also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                            Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                            without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                            in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                            line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                            Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                            express from Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                            is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                            responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                            deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                            fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                            Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                            />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                            been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                            If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                            at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                            arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                            London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers which
                            leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                            of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                            station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                            occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                            visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                            CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                            Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                            the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                            history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                            413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                            is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                            Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                            Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                            Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                            visit.</p>

                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                            during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s
                            steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                            wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                            [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                            devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                            portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                            to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                            brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                            and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                            excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                            fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                            finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                            hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                            Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                            level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                            thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                            takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                            Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                            possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                            sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                            and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                            house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                            and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                            the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                            a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                            breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                            constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                            Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                            marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                            filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                            illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                            cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                            change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at

                        <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                            bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                            approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                            The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                            behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                            the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                            out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                            hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                            beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most

                            and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                            from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                            steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                            of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>
