                    <head>ARMY REFORM</head>
                    <p>What Mr. Halane will do at the War Office lies in the womb of the future, but if we are to believe his own utterances we know
                    what he will not do. He has assured us very emphatically that he means to keep Army administration quite outside party politics,
                    and hopes to place its efficiency before all questions of economy and finace. Thee are brave words, rather suggestive of the novice
                    who has never yet benn under the Treasury lash, and we may recall them some day when he has been compelled to prune down his too
                    ambitious estimate to meet the requirements of some cheese-paring Budget. Another promise will be more easily kept. Mr Haldane should
                    have no difficulty in maintain pleasant relations with his military colleagues. the expert memmbers of the Army concil, and will avoid friction 
                    cause by differeces of opinon and want of personal sympathy which certainly porevailed often during the late regime.
                    The new secaratary of state has the advantage of an affable and concililiatory manner, and he has begun
                     well by a franl admission of his ignoreance of army affairs and his willingnedd to be guided by those who are better informed.
                    The chief fault in Mr. Arnold-Forster was that he knew everything better than anyone else. He was, moreover 
                    tied and bound by the previously-expressed views on some of the most intricate points in a business of the most extreme difficulty. 
                    Mr. Haldane tells us he has an open mind and if this attitude is lasting and permits him to accept the best 
                    that his predecessors have already given us, there may be some hope of a settlement of matter still in a fluid condition.</p>
                    <p>We hear much of the provision of a national army as the chief aim to be helf in view by our new War Office administrator, 
                    and no one will question its paramount importance. The phrase is mere bombastunless it is analysed and an exact definition arrived at. The commom 
                    idea is that defence of Great Britain is the principal raison detre of a national army. Many people discount this on the faith or rather hasty 
                    conclusions that invasion is out of the question. We leave this consideration aside, convinced that 
                    our real and more pressing needs lie beyond the four seas- needs at the remote extremities of our far-flung
                     frontier line, and no doubt for the moment in abeyance. Yet our army exsits primarily for foreign service, for the 
                    current police duties of the Empire and to meet the larger and more desperate emergencies that may some day arise. 
                    To prepare for them acequately is the true role of the far-seeing War Minister, and the best, the only effective, 
                    means is the constitution of an enormus reserve of stored up strength available for prompt mobilisation in the hour 
                    of trial. The auxiliary forces can never be utilised on their present footing, and we know now that the 
                    sugguested organization of a home service army will not work on the lines proposed by Mr. Arnold-Forester. The 
                    necessary personnel are not forthcoming; the men will not join the newly devised regiments, for some 
                    unexplained reason another instance of the caprices of voluntary enlistment. The problem remains to be 
                    solved by Mr. Haldane, if indeed, he touches it at all unless it is forced upon him.</p>
                    <p>He has a full programme and has many urgent needs on his card. The question of recruiting is, as ever, 
                    of the first importance, and likely to become accentuated should the party now in power be beguiled 
                    into coqueting with Home Rule. It has been pointed out that with an independent Parliament in Dublin 
                    the British Army would look in vain for Irish recruits, hitherto so valuable an addition to the forces 
                    of the crown. Apart from their soldierly qualities, the loss in numbers would be felt seriously. 
                    Mr. Haldane has declared himself, as might have been expected, the determined opponent of any form of conscription. 
                    What if it is forced upon him as the direct result of making Irishmen foreigness? Let us hope that 
                    the notion is far-fetched and that the evil consequences of Home Rule in this regard may be averted. 
                    A more pressing requirement today is to find officers for all branches of the service and more particularly 
                    the auxiliary forces, where the dearth constantly increases. Neither the Militia nor the Volunteeers can 
                    take their place in the national array until this defect is mended, and the remedy, except by regular 
                    payment is not easy to find. The shortage in the regulars has been in a measure dealt with by Mr. Arnold Forster, although 
                    hardly on large permanent lines. The late War Minister has to some extent smoothed his successor's 
                    path by carrying out the rearmament of the field artillery and the introduction of the new infantry rifle, 
                    but his legacy of the great General Staff is a more doubtful asset not readily or easily realisable.</p>

                    <head>CUT OUT HER TONGUE - A FANATIC WOMAN'S ATTEMPT TO WORK A MIRACLE</head>
                    <p>According to the "Straits Times" a procession of Hindus took place recently in Singapore, the men being under 
                    hypnotic influence and with barbs of iron and wood sticking in their flesh. Interest in the procession centred 
                    in a woman, known for her great piety. She joined in the procession with a brass pot, containing pure water, 
                    which she hoped would turn into milk.</p>
                    <p>To her disappointment and dismay she found on uncovering the pot at her destination that the water was 
                    unchanged. Not to be outdone, she tried to bring about another miracle. Seizing a knife which she carried, 
                    she cut off her tongue about an inch from the end and laid it on a leaf in front of her. With blood dripping 
                    from her mouth, she knelt before this bit of tongue, praying and waiting for what remained of it in her mouth 
                    to grow to its original length. The temple was filled with spectators, who remianed till a late hour to see 
                    miracle number two brought off.</p>
                    <p>The woman waited till a little past midnight, most of the time in a kneeling posture, but the tongue would 
                    not grow. The temple authorities advised her to return home, as they declared her not "good enough for miracles."</p>

                    QUESTION OF THE LEADERSHIP.
                    
                    London, February 5.
                    
                    The Unionist party will meet next week in order to consider the position.
                    
                    The ‘Time says that Mr. Chamberlain desires to make the tariff reform paramount in thepolioy of the Unionists. It is understood l that Mr. Balfour will not assent, considering it inexpedient in view of the result of the elections. If Mr. Balfour adheres to this standpoint, Mr. Chamberlain, who is personally unwilling to take the leadership, will propose a third person, probably Mr, Long, to lead the party. Mr. Balfour deolines to acquiesce an 1 considers it highly inadvisable to exclude from the party the Unionists who do not oonour in tbe Chamberlaini te fiscal policy.
                    
                    The Unionist newspapers are divided on the leadership of the party. The “Standard,” the "Morning Post,” and the "Globe’^are strongly Chamberlainite. Others uphold Mr. Balfour, The "Times” strongly deprecates any widening of the cleavage and considers^that in the present situation the Unionist party has no nee 1 to formulate a vary definite policy. It is noteworthy that the personal relations between Mr. Balfour and Mr. Chamberlain are most friendly.	(Reuter)</p>
