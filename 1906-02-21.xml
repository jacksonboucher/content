                    <head>LANCASHIRE COTTON BOOM</head>
                    <p>It is so inspiriting to bear of any British manufacturing industry in a
                        highly prosperous condition despite hostile foreign tariffs that patriotism
                        shrinks from casting doubt on the continuance of the phenomenal boom in
                        English cotton goods. This happy change from the long period when so many
                        Lancashire mills were either closed or only running half-time began eighteen
                        months ago, the American “corner” in the raw material haring utterly
                        collapsed for the time being. In itself, this sodden expansion was both
                        natural and legi¬timate ; in all parts of the world, stocks in hand had
                        almost reached exhaustion point, owing to the prolonged limitation of
                        supply. When, therefore, millowners were enabled, by toe heavy fall in the
                        price of raw cotton, to increase output with good prospect of substan¬tial
                        profit, foreign importers from Manchester hastened to replenish their stocks
                        at the lower rates. But another effect was produced by this sudden
                        augmentation of the external de¬mand. It stimulated the building of new
                        factories to an unprecedented extent; a cor¬respondent of the "Morning Poet”
                        estimates that in another six months, Lancashire will have in operation
                        between three and four million spindles and forty-five thousand looms more
                        than existed when the boom began. The future output will thus be increased
                        by 10 percent., and should the foreign demand slacken, over-production will
                        be sure to involve the inevitable penalty. But there is another menace, and,
                        perhaps, of even more grave character. The American "corner” is scotched,
                        not killed, and it only requires the stimulus of a short crop to ran up
                        prices to record level, again paraysing the great Lancashire industry. There
                        can never be any real safeguard against that standing danger until the
                        British Cotton- Growing Association succeeds in its patriotic endeavour to
                        render England independent of the New Orleans supply.</p>

                    <head>NILE VALLEY COMPANY</head>
                    <p>In another column we publish a report of the important meeting of the Nile
                        Valley Company held on Monday week. At that meeting the reconstruction
                        proposals were unanimously agreed to, the quotation harden¬ing perceptibly
                        as soon as the news reached the market. Among the economies which are to be
                        effected are a reduction in the managing director’s salary from £1,000 to
                        £230 e year, with 2 1/2 percent commission on dividends, a reduction of £100
                        in the secretarial fees and office charges, a diminution in the fee of the
                        consulting engineer by 250gs, and a decrease of £900 in directors’ fees.
                        These, it may be argued, are comparatively small retrenchments, but we
                        understand that they may be taken as indicative of a policy of financial
                        reform which is to be pursued as assiduously in Egypt as in London. The Nile
                        Valley is a very fair mining risk, and it is by no means unlikely that
                        shareholders who have gone into the re¬construction will see the whole of
                        their money back in due time.</p>

                    <head>THE SUCRERIES</head>
                    <p>It was stated a few days ago that the Empain group of Brussels had decided to
                        taka in hand the reconstruction of this unfortunate Egyptian sugar concern.
                        On enquiries made in Paris circles in close touch with the Empain group, I
                        am (a correspondent of a financial contemporary says) able to state that the
                        news is not likely to be true ; so far, not the least confirmation exists.
                        M. Empain’s visit t> Cairo, where the affairs of the newly promoted
                        Helio¬polis Tramway Company required hi presence, baa no doubt given rise to
                        the rumour. On the other hard, it is more than ever certain (adds the
                        correspondent) that Sir Ernest Cassel and his friends are actively engaged
                        in the reconstruction scheme.</p>

                    <p>As so many people seem to ignore the actual text of i he law concerning dogs,
                        we may state that the order relating thereto runs as follows: - "All cogs
                        running in the streets or public places in the town of Cairo or suburbs,
                        must be muzzled or led on a leash. In either case they most wear a collar

                    <p>Football.</p>
                    <p>A capital game of football was witnessed at Gheziret Badrane last Friday,
                        when the home earns and the R.E. met in their return match. The game was a
                        very fast one and not until the final whistle blew did the tremendous
                        excite­ment cease from reigning. In the first hail the exchanges were of an
                        even character, and both custodians were called upon in torn. A notable
                        feature of the match was the excellent exhibition given by the visitors’
                        goalkeeper and many of his saves were really brilliant. When well into the
                        second half, Simmonds scored a beautiful goal for the home team after a
                        pretty piece of individual play. There was no further scoring and so the
                        game conclude in a win for the Railway Institute by l-0 after a well
                        contested game. Mr. Trotter was referee.</p>

                        conditions of Egypt are reviewed. The writer, after starting with the
                        contrary view, concludes that the continuous increase in land values in
                        Egypt is a solid basis tor the country's prosperity. One of the most
                        investing points in the article is the reference to the great difficulty in
                        the future, when Lord Cromer’s guidance of Egypt comes to an end, for it
                        will be a serious matter to find a successor. The Capitulations are, it is

                        writer gees on to state that the ranks and decorations con­ferred by the

                        powerful company which proposes to fill the agricultural lands in the
                        western part of the town and raise them to the town level, the company to be
                        granted half the land thus reclaimed. It is said that the Government is
                        considering the proposal favourably. But, on the other hand, this seems
                        doubtful, as it would be cheaper for the Government to do the work unaided.

                    <p>THE PRINCE OF LAND</p>
                    <p>WHAT THE COMPANY IS DOING.</p>
                    <p>A slight decrease in the value of land at Zeitoun has been noticed since the
                        formation of the Cairo Electric Railways and Heliopolis Oasis Company.
                        Speculators have been soared at the immense quantity of land which this
                        company could place on sale at a low price</p>
                    <p>We do not think, however, that these appre­hensions are justifiable. In the
                        first place, the company has no interest in selling its lands before the
                        construction of’ the electric railways, the tran ways, the roads, etc.
                        Second­ly. as the real cost price of these lands is rather high, it is
                        impossible for them to sell them at a low price. In this connection it is to
                        be noted that, albeit the price paid to the Government for the land is very
                        small, the sum necessary to give it a market value will be enormous. There
                        is a costly railway to be built, tramways to be laid, a supply of water and
                        electricity to be furnished, roads to he made, pavements, public parks,
                        etc,etc. Briefly, after spending £*00.000, as the area of the laud which is
                        to be sold in lots amounts to two million square metres, the “immediate”
                        price of the lands for sale comes to 40 piastres a square metre. We have
                        said the “immediate” price because the price must be increased every year
                        and this for some time, through losses on the working of the railway, the
                        tram­ways, the distribution of water and electricity. It is certain that the
                        rentals for the villas and hotels on the construction of which the company
                        is to spend from £400 000 to £500,000 will hardly suffice to make up for
                        these initial losses of exploitation. To all this must be added interest on
                        £1.200,000 to £1.800.000, which, at 5 per cent., represents an annual anm
                        60000 to 65000</p>
                    <p>All this enumeration of charges brings ns to the conclusion that if the
                        “immediate” cost price is 40 piastres per square metre, this price mast be
                        increased by 8 to 3^ piastres a year to keep pace with the interest on the
                        money expended</p>
                    <p>With the view of granting certain advant­ages to those persons who are the
                        first to come and build on the Oasis, it is possible, and even probable,
                        that the company will sell a hun­dred lots of 1,000 to 2,000 square metres,
                        at the maximum, at lower than cost price, on condition only that houses are
                        construct­ed the eon within a year ; bat, as we said above, it is not these
                        hundred lots of land to be sold cheap which is likely to have an influence
                        on the value of land at Zeitoun or Matarieh.</p>

                    <head>HEDJAZ RAILWAY</head>
                    <p>A Syrian trader who has recently arrived in Egypt from Palestine informed one
                        of our representatives yesterday that a considerable movement of troops,
                        mainly infantry of the Nisam (first line) from Ma’an to Qala’st Medawara,
                        had recently taken place. Five thousand men are now engaged on railway work
                        near Medawara, where water abounds and where there is a certain amount of
                        cultivation. These troops were all armed with the Martini.</p>
                    <p>Preliminary surveys of the Ma’an-Akaba route having proved that a line
                        between these points would be very costly and that the want of water would
                        be a serious impediment to construction, it was finally decided to consider
                        the question of a line between Qala’at Medawara over the Hisma plateau. A
                        pre­liminary survey of the line by a party com j posed of an Italian, two
                        Turkish engineers, and a Pole showed that no great natural difficulties
                        existed, and in September last three Germans, who were said to have come
                        from Akaba, arrived at Damascus from Me dawara. having made a farther survey
                        of the route. The construction of embankment between Medawara and Akaba has
                        already commenced, and a considerable amount of material for the
                        construction of bridges has been sent down.</p>
                    <p>Medawara, which lies about 120 kilometres S.S.E. of Ma’an, is an excellent
                        base for the construction of a branch line. It is well sup plied with water,
                        cultivation flourishes, and provisions can be obtained on the spot The
                        rolling stock of the line will shortly be largely increased, 10 large Kraus
                        engines (all made in Germany) and about 150 carriage* and trucks having been
                        ordered. The first lot of engines will arrive very shortly, at d sir greatly
                        needed as the rolling stock on the main line from Damascus to Medawara has
                        suffered greatly from inexperienced engineers, and in most cases requires a
                        thorough repair and overhaul. The Bedouins have given heauthorities very
                        little trouble lately having been timorised into peaceful ways by the Turk
                        and Circassian mounted guards and no opposition is to be apprehended on the
                        line between Akaba and Medawara.</p>

                    <p>CORRESPONDENT'S CRITICISM</p>
                    <p>DEARTH OF LOCAL CANVASES</p>
                    <p>A Cairo correspondent writes to ns as</p>
                    <p>follows :—</p>
                    <p>Those who visit the “Cercle Artistique” expecting to find, as in previous
                        years, a collec­tion of charming views of Egypt and the East, by artists all
                        more or less connected with the country, are likely to experience some
                        disappointment. The present exhibition, which figures under the name of
                        “L’Exposition des Beanx Arts,” is composed almost entirely of a series of
                        pictures which, after having been displayed in the studios and galleries of
                        Paris, have journeyed to Egypt in search of public favour. Amongst them are
                        several of undoubt­ed merit, and these will be found well worthy of a visit.
                        It is equally true, however, that the collection includes a great many which
                        do not rise beyond the level of mediocrity.</p>
                    <p>But apart from the questions of merit or demerit, what strikes the Cairene is
                        the sweeping change made in the nature of the exhibition by the elimination
                        from it of what constituted the principal charm of previous shows, namely,
                        their essentially local character. It may well be doubted whether this new
                        departure will ’ render the exhibition more attractive either 1 to residents
                        or strangers. The former class are naturally more interested in
                        representations of Egyptian life and scenery, than in views of foreign
                        countries, whilst the latter class will 1 hardly be attracted by works which
                        they have already had opportunities of seeing in Europe, and which include
                        such well worn subjects as l the Arc de Triomphe, Notre Dame, and the
                        Parisian boulevards.</p>
                    <p>It is true that in one room of the building some of what may be called local
                        pictures are displayed. But they are insignificant in number, end the room
                        is so badly lighted that it is difficult to form an opinion as to their
                        merits. So little have they been considered by the promoters of the
                        exhibition that by f*r the greater n amber have not been even mentioned in
                        the catalogue. Here also one looks in vain for the names of Talbot Kelly,
                        John Varley, alfred East. Sir John Rogers, Binder Scarselli, and others,
                        whose works formed such an attractive feature in previous exhibitions, and
                        whose absence from the present one everyone interested in art in Egypt must
                        deplore.</p>

                    <head>SAVOY CONCERT</head>
                    <p>Fraulein Nelly Schlar-Brodmann and Herr Buff Gressen gave a very interesting
                        concert on Sunday night at the Savoy Hotel, which was well attended and
                        obviously more than satisfied the audience. The acoustics of the concert-
                        room militated against the complete success of either artist; both would
                        have been heard to better advantage in an opera-house, espe­cially Herr Buff
                        Gressen, whose powerful and very pure tenor organ did not quite accom­modate
                        itself to the conditions. None the less he sang admirably, his rendering of
                        the frail romance “In fernem Lande,” from Partial, and of Lohengrin's
                        “Alschied,” the latter given as an encore, being extremely thorough and
                        artistic, and after a course if Mediterranean misreadings of Wagner it was
                        delightful to hear a German do full justice to music that can never perhaps
                        be fully appreciated south of the Alps and the Loire. Fraulein Brodmann sang
                        well throughout but for one noticeable mistake over a drop 'hat should have
                        been clean but she slurred over three notes. She was at her best in the
                        three Schumann songs, and gave a good rendering of Tosti’s Ninon, but her
                        voice suffered from the room. In a concert- ball or opera-house it would
                        have been far more attractive, but one can hardly criticise a performer who
                        has not had time to learn the acoustics of the Savoy ball-room.</p>

                    <head>SHEPHEARD'S SMALL DANCE</head>
                    <p>There was a numerous assembly on Monday night at Shepheard’s, when one of the
                        usual small dances was in progress, and though there was perhaps a smaller
                        proportion of residents and those living in other hotels present than in the
                        commencement of the season, there was no diminution in the numbers of those
                        who joined in the dance or amused themselves in less active fashion in the
                        comfortable hall- passage. Nearly every one in the hotel must have been
                        present, with the exception of the tired and travel-stained wayfarers from
                        the further East, who filed through the brightly dressed crowd on their way
                        to their rooms during the evening. The parquet floor if the Egyptian hall
                        was in perfect condition and attracted several who thought their dancing
                        days were over, and there were many who refused to tear themselves away from
                        the festive scene till tin orchestra had resolutely refused to play a last
                        encore. The programmes of the popular belles are now so crowded that their
                        admirers have to console themselves with what are called “out dances,” and
                        the extra waltzes given as encores are also eagerly sought after. It is to
                        be feared that the hum-drum ances of England with their scarcity of men will
                        no long-r he welcomed by those who n>n ^e danger of having their heads

                        are apprehend ed for the Thursday settlement. Since the 22nd of January, 40

                    <p>London, February 20.</p>
                    <p>House or Commons.—Sir H. Campbell-Ban­nerman said that so far as he knew the
                        Algeciras Conference was proceeding slowly but satisfactorily. We were
                        giving France our utmost diplomatic support without the slightest prejudice
                        to our amity with other Powers. He emphatically declared that the
                        understanding with France was as strongly entrenched as ever. He defended
                        the giving immediately of a responsible Government to the Transvaal. The
                        Government’s great aim in flaming a constitu­tion would be to avoid any
                        appearance of unfairness.</p>
                    <p>He reiterated the accusation that the condi­tion of Chinese labour was
                        servile and cruel. No Chinaman desirous of returning home would be kept back
                        against his will. (Reuter)</p>
