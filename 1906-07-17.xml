                    <p>Tuesday, July 17, 1906.</p>
                    <p>AN EGYPTIAN AMALGAMATION</p>
                    <p>It appears that the amalgamation of the Egyptian Land and General Trait,
                        limited, with the Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Company, Limited, is,
                        the “Financial Times" says, not to be amplitude so smoothly and easily as
                        seemed likely at the start It will be remembered that the proposal wu that
                        the shareholders of the former Company should exchange their shay for those
                        of the latter Company, giving six for one. The agreement was signed subject
                        to the approval of the shareholders in general meeting^and the Directors of
                        both Companies recommended their shareholders to give such approval It is
                        interesting to note in the light of subsequent events that the Egyptian land
                        and General Trust’s oironlar farther stated that a very general desire had
                        been expressed by a large body of shareholders to carry oat the proposed
                        amalgamation. Both Companiesoalled meetings for the 19th inly for the
                        purpose of ratifying the agreement, and the Egyptian Delta Lard and
                        Investment Company took the opportunity to seek for powers to raise its
                        nominal capital from £250,000 to £500,000 and make soma minor alterations in
                        its articles of association. This was how the matter stood until the
                        shareholders of the Egyptian Land and General Trust received an
                        extraordinary oironlar, in which the attention of the shareholders is called
                        to the proposal of the Delta Company to increase its capital, and they are.
                        told “ Your Directors have not been advised when or at what price it is
                        contemplated to make the new issue, bat it is obvious that the apparent
                        imminence of so large an issue of new shares mast prevent the vain of the
                        shares bearing the proportion which existed at the date of the provisional
                        contract to the assets of the Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Company,
                        Limited, already acquired.” The Directors on aoooont of what appears to be
                        an imaginary change in the condition say that they can no longer take the
                        responsibility of recommending the confirmation of the agreement When we
                        read this oironlar (says one confrère) we were at a loss to understand how
                        the difficulty could have arisen. The statement lint the Directors au the
                        Trust Company had no knowledge of the time when and the terms upon which the
                        Delta Company proposed to issue the new Bare oonld suggest no less to ns
                        than that the Boards of the two Companies had come to loggerheads over the
                        aftermath of this negotiations and oonld no longer disease since a simple
                        matter. Upon inquiry, however, w learn that the Delta Company knew nothing
                        whatever of the Trust Company’s objection to the increase of capital until
                        the Eire lar from wbiob we have quoted bad beec posted. This makes the
                        oiroular utterly in comprehensible. It most be remembered that the agreement
                        had been signed subject to the ratification of the shareholders on the 19th,
                        and that the Delta Company would not obtain authority for the increase of
                        its capital until that day, so that it would be impossible for the new
                        shares to be issued before the shareholders of the Trust Company had become
                        shareholders of the Delta Company. In any pro rata issue after that they
                        would have an opportunity of subscribing their quota and rr training their
                        proportionate interest ia the assets of the Company. If, therefore, the
                        Trust Company’s Directors had obtained an under taking from the Delta
                        Company that the new shares would only be issued to the shareholders in
                        proportion to they're holding there would not have been the slightest ground
                        for any orange in their attitude towards the amalgamation. We have little
                        doubt that this or some other satisfactory undertaking would have been given
                        by the Delta Company had request been made for it, as there is nothing
                        what-, ever in the whole transaction to suggest that any unfair advantage
                        was to be taken of the Trust Company’s shareholders. The circular of the
                        latter Company distinctly, though in-directly, indicates that there is some
                        ground f )r objecting to the action of the Directors of the Delta Company,
                        but they did not attempt to get the matter cleared up. It appears, indeed,
                        that for some inexplicable reason the Directors of the Egyptian Land and
                        General Trust Company having made a bargain regretted it The agreement
                        provided that the two Companies should continue to conduit their own
                        business until completion, and that the Egyptian Delta Land and Investment
                        Company should lend to the Trust Company not exceeding £57,000 to enable the
                        latter Company to meet payments falling due on lands already purchased. It
                        would seem probable, therefore, that this money, or some of it, has bear
                        advanced, and that it is after being relieved of their financial
                        embarrassments that the Directors of the Trust Company see fresh light on
                        the subject. Had they sought to have the difficulties removed before
                        approaching their shareholders, it would be possible to understand their
                        change of attitude, but their failure to do so suggests that they were
                        anxious not to be oonviooed.</p>

                    <p>Sir,—Fending the examination promised by the "Chsmber of Commeroe Journal”
                        for next month's issue, might I anticipate that enquiry by giving an opinion
                        in whioh I believe 1 am supported by a general oonsensna i To explain the
                        canse of the success of Qerman competition in Egypt and elsewhere one need
                        only sum it np in two words : German adaptability. </p>
                    <p>Why Qerman goods are making suoh inroads every where — in 12 years, vide the
                        "Chamber of Commeroe Journal,” they rose fromi 2.5 % to 4.4 %—is not because
                        of their superior’ quality, nor of their oheaper prices ; bat be-canse, like
                        the American, the Qerman manufacturer, following the advioe of his agent,
                        goes ont of the way, often at a sacrifice, to suit and so win the foreign
                        market Our polioy is to soit onrselve* ; to ram ont patterns and prices down
                        the customer's throat. No doubt onr goods are better made, and there is a
                        majority who .requite willing to pay for the British finish. WW they objeot
                        to is the British pattern—as immutable as the laws ol the Meaes and
                        Persians. When, however, their objeotion is mildly conveyed by the agent to
                        the home manufacturer, what is the result 1 I will tell yon. Some years ago
                        a British agent urged his firm to imitate a particular shape of spade. What
                        was the reply! “We manufacture only one shape of spade ; they oan either
                        like it or lump it.” And this is oharacteristio of the attitude of the Trade
                        Union. </p>
                    <p>The result is, as the plain faots and figures ol the Alexandria Chamber of
                        Commerce how, that the Qerman steps in, matches the looal article at a
                        oheaper prioe, and takes away onr custom. </p>
                    <p>The other potent asset in the Qerman hands is oredit. Onr terms are prompt
                        cash, oasb against doouments, or e.o.d. If the natives won't pay, we don’t

                    <p>A few days ago an individual went to a large English shop in Cairo and bought
                        articles to the value of 6 or 7 pounds. When he went to the desk to pay for

                    <p>London, July 16. </p>
                    <p>A Bine Book has been published on Th. Tnroo-Egyptian frontier dispute. A
                        despot from Lord Cromer to Sir B. Grey, dated 31a May, referred to the
                        danger of an advance o the Canal. A serions attack on Egypt seems not of the
                        question, bat a possible raid might be attempted with a view to loaning an
                        out burst of fanaticism in Egypt Snob an attempt would have been of a most
                        desperate nature as a reverse would mean the annihilation o the attackers ;
                        bat it Beemed undesirable t take risks, so the Navy undertook to defeat the
                        Canal. / </p>
                    <p>Dealing with the influence of the Pan-Islamic Press, Lord Cromer doubts as to
                        whether an; newspapers wonld rival its mendacity and mis representation of
                        faots, bat opines that i should be left alone for the present, trusting t
                        time and relianoe on the true fiaota oonvinoini the Egyptian pnblio of the
                        folly of thoa preaching Pan-Islamism. Bat if the Pres seriously menaoes
                        pnblio tranquillity, it wanly be the duty of the Government to resort h
                        repression. Anyhow, this conolnsion may bi drawn abundantly olear, namely,
                        that thi British garrison mast be permanently increase! at the ooat of the

                    <p>In the House of Commons last week Mr Ashley asked the Secretary of State for
                        Wai if there was any intention to farther redaa the British garrison in
                        Egypt, in view of thi fanatical feeling existing in that entry ant in the
                        North of Africa generally. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Runoimao (for Mr. Haldane) : Tbi answer is in the negative. </p>

                    <p>"Lord Cromer, in a telegram dated the Htl inst., stated that the order
                        hitherto existing ii Egypt has been that no pigeon-sh oring wai to take
                        plaoe without the oonaent of the Model of the village, and that sinoe the
                        Denishwai incident the general offioer commanding it Egypt was about to

                    <p>THE FASHN TRAGEDY. </p>
                    <p>Various are the vereio.s asoribed to the motives of Ahmed Qomaa, who was
                        lately condemned by the Native Court of Minieh to the extreme penalty for
                        the mnrder, a month ago, at Fashn, in Upper Egypt, of a Greek woman and her
                        nieoe. The sentenoe has not yet been oarried ont, owing to the oomplete
                        disavowal of Qomaa as to having committed the orime. </p>
                    <p>Justice has been suspended apparently owing to the foot that an enquiry is
                        being instituted by the Hellenio Consular Conrt of Alexandria against
                        Sotiris Cottai, who is aoonsed of complicity in the orime ; and it is
                        probably owing to some legal adjustment being necessary between the two
                        oonrts oonoerned that this delay has taken place, otherwise the failure of
                        the Native Tribunal to exeonte its sentenoe would appear incomprehensible.
                        Two motives are attributed : one of robbery, for the deoeased woman had in
                        her dwelling the snm of one hundred and odd pounds, oolleoted in rents and
                        from the sale of ootton seed ; the other, outrage committed on the person of
                        her niece, though of this there is no absolute proof. </p>

                    <p>In the Chancery Division last week, before Mr. Jostioe Neville, Mr. Edwin
                        William Streeter, a jeweller, sued the Egyptian Gold and Gem Syndicate,
                        Limited, claiming a declaration that the defendants’ rights' under an
                        agreement of Maroh 19, 1903, had lapsed, and that they had no right or title
                        to a oertain concession or prospeoting lioense specified in the agreement. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Spence, in opening the case, said Mr. Streeter obtained a concession from
                        the Egyptian Government, whioh authorised the plaintiff for a term of thirty
                        years to take preoions stones and sell them in a particular distriot
                        described in the oonoession. One tenth of the profits made on the work-ng of
                        the eenoern was to be paid to the Egyptian Government. </p>
                    <p>There was to be a rental of £305. Mr. Streeter entered into an agreement with
                        a Mr. Oxley in January, 1903, by which Mr. Oxley was to purchase the entire
                        oonoession. Before that time Mr. Streeter applied to the Egyptian Government
                        for a prospeoting license. The mining oonoession was merely for precious
                        stones, and did not give the right to the gold or minerals. The prospecting
                        lioense was for three years. The holder was not allowed to keep any preoious
                        metals, but was allowed to see whether there was gold. It was not granted at
                        the time of the agreement to Oxley, but it was granted in April, 1903. It
                        was to last for three years ; the rent for ths first year was to be £1,030.
                        and the term was to expire in April, 1906. Mr. Oxley was to promote a
                        ■vndinate for the acnoisition of the nronartv. and plaintiff was to receive
                        £7,003 and a number of folly paid up ahares on the exeroise of the option.
                        The option was exercised in September, 1904 The shares had never been issued
                        to the plaintiff, nor had he been paid money.</p>

                        contemporary remarks t </p>
                    <p>A sign of the times is the fact that several Egyptian firms of stockbrokers
                        are about to commence business in London. Hitherto the market for Egyptian
                        shares, except in the oase of a few specialities, has been a very limited
                        one in this country. The faot that a number of important Cairo firms
                        oonsider it good business to bave branch establishments over here seems to
                        indioate that an attempt is to be made to broaden this interest. Certainly
                        the reoent history of several Egyptian enterprises gives oolour to the idea
                        that our Cairo friends bave kept the good things to themselves, and have
                        given ns the benefit of ventures like the Nile Valley Company. This time it
                        has been a oase of “spoiling the Britishers.” </p>

                    <p>In the foreoast issued at the beginning of May it was pointed out that

                    <p>These early and abnormal rains raised the level of the Blue Nile considerably
                        and thus converted what would have been s very low summer supply into a

                    <p>It was pointed out also in the May foreoast that the meteorological

                        Africa and the neighbouring portion of the Indian Ocean were markedly

                        flood is anticipated so that it is desirable to summarise the data which are
                        available more fully than has usually been done. </p>

                    <p>Rain fell at a few places on the Sudan plains but in small quantities only.

                    <p>Lake Viotoria was very high in oonse-qnenee of the heavy rains of March,
                        April and May ; the Bahr el Jebel at Gondokoro increased a little ; the
                        Sobat began to rise at Nasser on May 1st, and at Doleib Hilla a few days
                        later, after whioh it rose steadily. The Jar (Bahr el Ghasal) showed a
                        marked rise at the end of May. </p>
                    <p>The Blue Nile at Roseires commenced to rise in the middle of the month. </p>
                    <p>It will be seen from the above that the rains set in somewhat later than the
                        average and were moderate in strengh. </p>
                    <p>The continnanoe of heavy rain in the equatorial region, Zanzibar, eto., was
                        an unfavourable sign, as also were the unsteadiness of the air movement over
                        the Arabian Sea, and theiUrge"Iw«mulation of snow in the Himalayas which the
                        Meteorological Department of India reports. Atmospherio pressure over North
                        East Africa was in exoess of the normal and this has hitherto been an
                        unfavourable sign. </p>
                    <p>Conditions in June.—The rainfall during this month was above the average at
                        Zvwbar. It was average at Wan in the Bshr el Gbszal and at Gor d ikoro on
                        the Bahr el Jebel, thongh somewhat deficient at Wsdelai. </p>
                    <p>On the White Nile rain is never heavy in June and the amounts recorded this
                        year vary considerably, being in exoess at Dueim and deficient at Khartoum. </p>
                    <p>On the Blue Nile the rainfall was above the average at Roseires and below it
                        at Wad Medani, while at Qallabat and Gedaref it was about normal. </p>

                        the Atbara; the White Nile is unimportant as it will shortly be held baok by

                    <p>The rise of the Sobut continued steadily throughout the month ; the Blue Nile at Roseires oommeooed a rapid rise on the 16th, whioh bas oontintmd almost uneheoked to the present date; and affected the Khartoum gauge from the beginning ot July.

                    <p>It should be remembered that the favourable conditions shown by the Roeeiret and Khartoum gauges are partly due to the abnormal rains of February and March, so that the gauge readings tend to make the rainfall of Abyssinia appear heavier than it actually was.

                        the present time it may be ssid that there has been an improvement and rains
                        from being weak have increased in the Abyssinian area, though they still do
                        not appear to be muoh above the average. In the first half of Joly

                        weak and undecided in most plaoes, though at Roseires and at Kodok they have
                        been somewhat above the average in June, rainfall at Zanzibar on the const
                        of -German Bast Afrioe was still in excess, pointing to a continuation of an
                        ascensional current, and atmospherio pressure has been consistently above
