                    <p>THE LESSONS OF THE MANEUVERS. </p>
                    <p> Through the Naval Manœuvres ended a fortnight ago and though a number of
                        correspondents have described what they saw the public will have to wait for
                        their history until the Admiralty’s report is issued. In the meantime,
                        though only provisional judgments can be formed on moat of the questions
                        connected with the operations, there are one or two pointa aa to which
                        opinions farce themselves upon the mind of observer., and some of these are
                        worth noting, eject, of forage, to reconsideration when the whole of the
                        facts become known. The theme of the macoeaviwwua war between two Naval
                        Powers, Red and Bine, of whom Red had more than twelve tore of Blue. Bine
                        being hope - leally the weaker fore was expected to attempt, by the attack
                        upon Red seaborne trade, to bring about such a dispersion of the Red forces
                        as to give himself a thane of an engagement against some isolated portion of
                        the Red ivories, presumably dispersed for the protection of Red’s trade. In
                        order to make the conditions of trade resemble those of war, Red trade was
                        represented by snob merchant ships as consented to take part in the game on
                        their homeward or outward voyages from or to Gibraltar. A bunch of trade
                        routes was defined, which ran np from Cape St. Viooent along the oat of
                        Portugal and Spain and branched off in the Bay of Biaoay to Milford Haven
                        and the Channel the Red Fleet started from Baglish ports, the Bine from
                        Queenstown and Berehiven. Bine appears to have well understood that Red
                        could anticipate him if any part of the area from which includes the Western
                        entrances to the Irish See, the Bristol Channel, and the English Channel,
                        and also in the Bay of Biscay. He therefore took his main forces both of
                        battleships and cruisers ont into the Atlantic and steamed outside the area
                        this forbidden to him and then south-eastward towards the Spanish coast.
                        There on his arrival he seems for a time, perhaps for twenty-four hours, to
                        have been able to moleit trade. What degree of damage he did can be
                        estimated only when it became known how many groups of trading ships passed
                        along the routes, and what proportion of them were molested by Blue
                        warships. The Red Command ier-in-Chief, Admiral Wilson, was not for a moment
                        induced to disperse his forces. He kept the Channel Fieet together and had
                        the Mediterranean Fleet kept together. So soon as he was snare that Bine had
                        left his porta and gone south he moved southwards, while the Mediterranean
                        Fleet was moved northwards so soon as it was clear that the Bine forces had
                        not gone sooth to come n on the trade routes behind it. But the Blue Admiral
                        divided his greatly inferior force, with the result that one fraction was
                        ought between the two Red Fleets, and driven by the Mediterranean Fleet into
                        the jaws of ,the Channel Fleet, and that the main body of the Blue Battle
                        Fleet was found by the Channel Float and chased into the English Channel,
                        which for the purpose of the attack on trade was on the board. The Blue
                        Cruiser Squadron was also caught by a superior Red force and suffered
                        fêtions loss of ships. Then the Red squadrons of battleships and croisera
                        swept np and down along the trade routes on a front of something like, a
                        hundred miles, combing the sea for Blue men of war. Had hostilities untinned
                        a few days longer it seems likely that the whole of the Blue fore would have
                        been destroyed. Suoh seems to be the general outline of what took place,
                        though it is an outline based upon incomplete information and may require to
                        be modified. The chief point to be borne in mind about the scheme of the
                        manœuvres is that Red was if every class of vessel more than twice as strong
                        as Blue, though in speed the Blue Squadrons had a slight advantage. If
                        therefore we are outroot in supposing that Admiral Wilson in a week rushed
                        the Blue forces, and in another week wand have annihilated them, and that
                        Red’s trade, therefore, could not have suffered very serious damage, the
                        moral to be drawn must be that if Great Britain were engaged in a war
                        against a single naval Power whose naval forgoes had less than half the
                        numerical strength of the British Navy, and if the British Navy were
                        commanded by an admiral as strong as Sir Arthur Wilson, while the enemy’s
                        Navy was no better handled than the Blue Fleet, then British trade would not
                        he subjected to very severe or onrushing losses and the British Navy would
                        in due time assert tokomak of the sea. But that is not more than the oonDtry
                        has a right to expect. Indeed, it is rather disappointing. No nappies that
                        the nation keeps a Navy on the Two Power standard to be able to congratulate
                        itself that its trade can be efficiently protected against the attack of one
                        Power. It would have been more interesting to have bad the experiment made
                        in conditions giving Bine a rather better thane, as would have been the case
                        it Red had been to Bine not as five to two bat as three to two. For this
                        reason we are not inclined to attach much importance to what may be called
                        the political theme of the manœuvres or to any inferences that could be
                        drawn from them as to the relative strength of navies. Nelson’s saying that
                        “only numbers can annihilate” implies that the side which has the number is
                        not properly handled unless it does annihilate the enemy. ("Morning Post”) </p>

                    <p>CAPSIZED OFF ALEXANDRIA. </p>
                    <p>SIX MEN DROWNED</p>
                    <p>News reached Alexandria yesterday of a shipping disaster off the Abonkir
                        coast by which six men lost their lives.</p>
                    <p>It appears that on the night of Monday a flotilla of Italian fishing boats
                        was returning to harbor, when one of their number, with a crew of ten,
                        capsized, owing to the high sea and strong wind that prevailed at the time.
                        The accident was unobserved by the other vessel’, an! it was only on their
                        return to harbor that the smack was missed.</p>
                    <p>Meantime a tragedy had been enacted. Of the crew of ten, two were on deck
                        when the boat capsized, one at the helm and the other on the look-out, the
                        rest being asleep below. Three of the latter were awakened by the shock and
                        managed to scramble on deck, when’s they clambered on to the helm, which had
                        become detached from the boat, along with the two other men. The five other
                        members of the crew sank with this boat, and it is believed that their
                        bodies are still in the vessel.</p>
                    <p>The five men managed to remain floating on the helm tilldaybreak, when a big
                        wave came and swept them into the water. Four were able to swim to an inlet,
                        but the other was too extant- e 1 and gave up the straggle for life. The
                        four men were afterwards picked np by a coastguard boat which was sent out
                        to their rescue and the body of the other was also recovered by the
                        coastguards. The latter was brought into town by h>s more fortunate comrades
                        and now lies in hospital, for the usual post-mortem examination.</p>
                    <p>The boat capsized in 13 fathoms of water, about a mile from the Montazah
                        coast.</p>
                    <p>The following are the names and ages of the members of the orew who were
                        drowned :— De Vincsan Domenico (13), Vinoensc Giovanni Livineo (40),

                    <p>The imports for the past month showed a decided improvement on the figures of
                        Jane, 1905, an increase of L.E. 193,015 being reported. The exports show a
                        decrease—only L E. 940,588 against L.E. 1,316,611—bnt if the whole period,
                        from January 1 to Jane 30, is taken into consideration, the results in both
                        exports and imports mast be pronounced highly satisfactory. The imports
                        total in the first half of 1905 L.E. 10,513,579, against L.E. 9,427,986, the
                        exports LE. 11,154,66^, against L.E 9,609,952. The increase, roughly
                        amounting to a million in one case and to a million and a half in the other,
                        is remarkably high. The figures for goods re exported daring the half-year
                        amount to L.E. 231,932, an increase of L.E. 67,392, and a slight increase is
                        noticeable in the total for goods in transit.</p>
                    <p>For the month there is an increase amounting to L.E. 115,349 in British
                        imports and a decided decrease (L.E. 54,106) in the total of exports.
                        British trade has, however, no reason to c explain of the last half-year,
                        daring which our imports have risen to L.E. 3,458,443, against LB. 3,143,862
                        in the corresponding period of 1905, and the exports from Egypt to Great
                        Britain to L.E. 5,592,473, against L.E. 4,756,248.</p>
                    <p>In comparing the June import and export figures of other countries with those
                        of previous years, we note no remarkable changes except in the case of
                        Russia. Imports from that country—which, as oar readers are aware, arrive in
                        aiment every case from the Black Sea ports—only amounted to L.E. 7,907,
                        about one-sixth of their total in Jane 1905.</p>
                    <p>In the export column there is a remarkable fall in the value of goods
                        exported to .Fiance — L.E. 57,673 against L E. 178,994 in 1905— which we
                        should like to see explained. But exports are low throughout—a decrease more
                        or less considerable being marked against Egypt in the case of nearly every
                        country that appears in the comparative tables as an importer of Egyptian
                        goods.</p>
                    <p>For the half year France follows Great Britain in the list of importers and
                        the Ottoman Empire is a good third, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Germany, and
                        Italy coming next. In the export columns, Germany—now becoming an excellent
                        customer—follows us with figures of L.E. 1,210,981, against L E. 866,774, in
                        the first halt of 1905. France is second, Russia third, and four’s comes the
                        Austro Hungarian Empire.</p>
                    <p>In the import lists we note again an increase in imported cereals both for
                        the month and the half year, and a still more remarkable increase in the
                        imports of "metals and mitai goods”—due to the expansion of the rolling
                        stook of the State Railways and the import of machinery.</p>
                    <p>The exports of cotton fell off daring the month as compared with June 1905
                        but the total value of the cotton exported between January 1 and Jane 30 of
                        the present year shows a large increase—L.E. 9,118,035 against LE. 7,175,950
                        in the first half of 1905.</p>

                    <p>The chief feature of the market throughout the month of Jane has been its
                        lethargy, says toe Journal of the British Chamber of Commerce. Sales for
                        immediate delivery have taken place on a very small scale, while prices have
                        shown a decided tendency to droop in spite of the high level maintained in
                        Manchester. Although arrivals have not been excessive, it is probable that
                        stocks in importers’ hands are heavier now than they were at the beginning
                        of the month.</p>
                    <p>A partial explanation of this state of things lies in the fact that all the
                        larger local dealers, with probably the majority of smaller ones, have
                        little confidence in the maintenance of present rates. Manchester quotations
                        are regarded as too high for a sixpenny basis. In other words, it is deemed
                        that manufacturers are working with such an ample margin on the present
                        value of raw cotton that they own well afford to reduce it, and probably
                        will reduce it should the American crop later on give promise of

                    <head>LOSS OF EGYPTIAN RELIC. </head>
                    <p>VIRGIN’S TREE” FALLS. </p>
                    <p>Egypt has lost a venerable relic. The “Virgin’s Tree” at Matarieh fell on the
                        14th in9t. and for Borne time to come the pions and the curious will miss an
                        object of great in tersest and holy associations. While there is no doubt
                        that the sycamore of Matarieh was not the original tree which sheltered the
                        Holy Family daring the flight to Egypt, tradition declares that it came from
                        the same stook— having been raised from the sued of the original sycamore.
                        Several descendants of the ''Virgin’s Tree” are now in existence, and we
                        hope to see the fallen tree replaced by one of its progeny.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">CARMEN. </hi></p>
                    <p>Carmen has always a peculiar charm of its own for the opera-goer, an I there
                        are few who have not witnessed with mixed feelings of pleasure and sorrow
                        the unravelling of the old story of fickle love, gallantry, and deception,
                        and finally shuddered at the tragic demise of the heartless coquette. In
                        Signora C. Esposito Carmen has a pleasing exponent, and although lacking in
                        vitality occasionally, her performance was a distinctly adoptable one.
                        Signorina Esposito possesses a voice of excellent quality, which she knows
                        well how to use. The same may also be said of Signorina Tina de Spada, who
                        was very successful as Mioaela. Signor Arrighetti’s Toreador received quite
                        an ovation. The famous song was exceedingly well rendered, and was heartily
                        encored As a whole, the production may be said to be a success. The chorus,
                        though small, sing with effect, and the orchestra is all that said be
                        desired. The absence of appropriate scenery, however, somewhat detracted
                        from the absolute success of the performance. This was painterly apparent in
                        the second act, and was a considerable handicap to the artistes concerned.
                        Between the third and fourth acts of the opera, a series of Greek classical
                        dances were given by Signora Artemis Colonna, who proved herself no tyro in
                        the art of graceful posing. Attired in a classical costume of soft clinging
                        silk, Signora Colonna treated us to a feast of sinuous evolutions ; each
                        gesture was carefully studied, changing quickly from grave to gay,
                        delightfully fresh and true to nature, at times weirdly picture que. Her
                        performance was certainly a meritorious one and was heartily applauded. To
                        night Faust will be staged. We on thoroughly recommend our patrons to pay
                        the Alhambra a visit. An Italian dramatic company is shortly repeated to
                        arrive at Alexandria and will give a series of twenty performances at the
                        Alhambra. </p>

                    <p>Played on the A.C.C. ground yesterday, and easily won by Alexandria. The Town
                        XI. won the toss, and Graves and Anbrey, aided by a good deal of luck, put
                        on 68 for the first wicket,when Aubrey was run oat through a bad call and a
                        fine piece of fielding by W. B. Peel Graves was bowled at 97 for a
                        distinctly lucky innings and Marsden and Carver then nude a long stand, both
                        scoring very freely all round the wicket Carver gave one chance which three
                        fieldsmen might have reached, and none aooep- te 1, but his innings was
                        otherwise marked by a number of very good strokes all round the wicket.
                        Dawson, Dealtry, and Soartb hit with great vigor at the dose of the innings.
                        The Ramleh batsmen could not play Mnstard, and with 6 wickets down for 13 a
                        record minimum for Alexandria cricket seemed assured, bat Bailey and
                        Merewether improved matters, the latter falling in the end to a magnificent
                        oatob. Mustard took six wickets for 34. For the losing side W. E. Peel
                        worked very hard in the field, saving any number of runs. The wicket bumped
                        atrociously and a really fast bowler would have done great physical damage.
