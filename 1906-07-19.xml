                    <p>THE PRESS.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harold Spender’s article, which we published in oar issue of yesterday,
                        contrast curiously with Professor Flinders Petrie's summary of the situation
                        in Egypt. The editor of the "Westminster Gazette" leaves his antiquarian
                        rival far behind as far as style is concerned; but if we may adopt the
                        ordinarily metaphor suggested by the title of his article he has made rather
                        a hush of his deductions by the assumption that pigeons are regarded as more
                        or less sacred by the fellaheen. Were this the tenth some of oar Egyptien
                        confrères, who are now advocating the own version of the Japanese to Islam,
                        would do well to send missionaries to the provinces of Egypt to check the
                        growth of a dangerous superstition. Bat Mr. Spender does not realise—why
                        should he! -that the causes of the Deuishwai outbreak (lie deeper. Professor
                        Petrie has understood them clearly enough, and his quotation of the old
                        adage, “Set a beggar on horseback and he will ride to the devil,’’ appears
                        to us to explain the Danishwai outrage far better than any theories as to
                        the persistence of pagan beliefs as exemplified in the reverence with which
                        pigeons are said to be regarded by oar villagers. The fact is that, as we
                        recently pointed out, the rural population has in pertain districts got ont
                        of hand, owing to the absence of adequate penalties for perjury and assaults
                        on the parson: criminals of a low mentality are more likely to be affected
                        by any anti-foreign movement than any other section of the community, and
                        the assertion that, beoanse the fellah does not read newspapers, he is
                        therefore mentioned by the Pan-Islamio or Anti-Christian movement that has
                        been preached by some of oar soi-disant Nationalists, falls, owing to this
                        fact that some fellaheen read and that those who on read — oven with
                        difficulty-generously supply their friends with the fruits of their
                        erudition.</p>
                    <p>A column or two from "A1 Lewa” or “Al Umma,” painfully spelt out, goes a long

                    <p>A Cairo cotemporary denies the statement chat “U Papagallo il Masti” has been
                        suppressed. We hope the report to which we gave credence was founded on
                        fact; otherwise we cannot bat think that toleration has been carried rather
                        too far. After the Denishwai incident and the highly unpleasant symptoms
                        which the frontier dispute with Turkey produced, tolerance is more likely
                        than vigorous action to be ousted as a sign of weakness. Sir Edward Grey's
                        warning and Lord Cromer's comments, recently published in the Bine-Book
                        ladling with the frontier dispute, will appear rather brute fulmina

                            and enohaina the readers' attention by the vividness of its pictures,

                    <p>London, July 18.</p>
                    <p>Lady Curzon is dead. She had been suffering from complications, a sequel to
                        her illness of two years ago.</p>
                    <p>Lady Curzon of Kedleston (» Mary Victo- ria Leiter) was born at Chicago, and
                        the daughter of the late L. Z. Leiter, a plutocrat of that city. Her great
                        talents and beauty, which had already made her one of the most popular
                        debutantes in Washington society in 1891, added to the interest excited by
                        the announcement of her engagement to the Hon. G. N. Curzon, and her
                        marriage to him in 1895, in which year her husband became Under-Secretary of
                        State for Foreign Affairs. In 1899 she accompanied her husband to India. As
                        wife of the Viceroy she had naturally enough to contend with certain
                        jealousies aroused by her American origin or by the unpopularity of the
                        Viceroy among a certain section of Anglo-Indian officials, both military and
                        civil. That she succeeded in overcoming them was a great testimony to her
                        ability and personal oharm. She fulfilled the onerous social duties of her
                        position with remarkable taot and graciousness, and the news of her serious
                        illness twc years ago caused a widespread expression of sympathy. General
                        regret will be felt at her death, and not least in Cairo, where she was with
                        her husband the guest of Lord and Lady Cromer as lately as the 26th November
                        last.</p>

                    <p>Sayid Hassan Bey El-Akkad, a notable of Cairo, who has long been known as one
                        of the native leaders who appreciate the British Occupation in Egypt,
                        publishes a statement in the native Press, three columns in length, severely
                        criticizing "Al-Mokattam” for ascribing religious fanaticism to the Egyptian
                        people and threatening the Egyptians with severe measures. Sayid El-Akkad
                        concludes as follows: "Consequently, I have to advise my brethren the
                        Egyptians to put full confidence in the British Government, which does not
                        intend to do them any harm, but on the contrary wishes them every
                        prosperity. England is just and wise and it is unreasonable to suppose that
                        she will ever demolish with her own hands in a day the proud and splendid
                        fabric of reform which she founded, r quarter of a century ago, on the basis
                        of justice and freedom. Let us all show Tmrpelves quiet and peaceful ; let
                        ns put aside all useless agitation. As for ‘Al-Mokattam,’ which speaks in
                        the name of the Occupation of Egypt, that journal has no private relations
                        with the occupante, as the simple are led to imagine.” </p>

                    <p>he Rabbi Farag Mizrahi, of Alexandria, writes to “Al-Minbar” to say that two
                        days ago he received a letter from a friend of his in Japan stating that the
                        Japanese were now busily engaged in taking notes from both the Bible and the
                        Koran with a view to discover religious principles: “The Japanese are
                        inclining to the belief that there is but one God ; and the majority of the
                        learned and heads of religions in Japan undoubtedly lean towards Islam.” Wo
                        may contrast with this statement the remark recently made to an interviewer
                        by the Marquis Ito—himself an agnobtic, by the way: “Whatever may be urged
                        against our reli- gion, I hardly think we are likely to exobaDge it for any
                        other creed, or that we have any reason to be ashamed of its fruits.” </p>
